### What are code reviews?

What are the code reviews? A code review is when YOU record a scrim reviewing another person's JavaScriptmas solution, providing constructive feedback.

*For a deep-dive into learning how to create Scrimba screencasts, I wrote this detailed article on the topic: [How to create Scrimba screencasts and turn them into a Scrimba course](https://selftaughttxg.com/2021/02-21/CreateAScrimbaScreencast/)*

### Day 12 challenge
#### Breakfast Menu
*Topic: .map()*
*Our restaurant menu currently only shows the breakfast menu,as it has been hard coded into the HTML file. However, we want to offer a dinner menu instead. Let's fix this using .map()*

1. First, fetch a reference to the menu <section> from the DOM. 
2. Set the innerHTML content of the menu <section> to...
3. the dinnerFoods array by mapping over the array and returning the following div for each food in the array: `<div class="food">FOOD VALUE HERE</div>` 
4. Remember to remove any separating commas between the food divs!

**The challenge provides all the HTML and CSS. We just need to write the JavaScript.**

First, we assign the menu variable using [getElementById()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_getelementbyid.asp) as follows:
```javascript
const menu = document.getElementById("menu");
```

Now let's take a look at the HTML `<div>` the challenge asks us to create:
```html
<div class="food">FOOD VALUE HERE</div>
```

**To solve the challenge, we will use [map()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp) as instructed, and we will use string interpolation to replace "FOOD VALUE HERE" for each item in the dinner foods array, using [join()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp) to remove the commas.**
```javascript
menu.innerHTML = dinnerFoods.map(item => `<div class="food">${item}</div>`).join('');
```

### Day 13 challenge
#### Emojify
*1. Write a function that checks if a lowercase word starts and ends with a colon. If it does, remove the colons and look up the word in the emoji object. If the word is in the emojis object, return the corresponding emoji.If it isn't, return the original word.*

*2. Write a function to find any emoji shortcodes in a phrase.Your function should map over each word in the phrase, emojify any word that begins and ends with a colon, then return the emojified phrase.Feel free to use your emojify function from the previous exercise!*

**We solve this challenge by creating two functions. The first function returns an emoji if they pass certain conditions and if it exists in the emoji object. The second function returns a sentence and utilizes the first function to replace applicable words with emojis.**

**Function 1**
Let's start with writing the first function. The challenge provides an emoji object. I created an emoji array by utilizing [Object.entries()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries) as follows:
```javascript
const emojisArray = Object.entries(emojis); 
    console.log(emojisArray);
[["smile", "üòä"], ["angry", "üò†"], ["party", "üéâ"], ["heart", "üíú"], ["cat", "üê±"], ["dog", "üêï"]]    
```

Now, we need to determine whether the passed-in word starts and ends with a colon. We use an [if statement](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp), [startsWith()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_startswith.asp), and [endsWith()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_endswith.asp).
```javascript
if(word.startsWith(':') && word.endsWith(':')) {

}
```

Next, we create a variable using [slice()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_array.asp) to remove the colons.
```javascript
const wordSlice = word.slice(1,-1)
```

Now, using a for loop, we iterate over the emoji array. If we find a matching word, we return the corresponding emoji. If we do not find a matching word, we return the wordSlice variable (returning the wordSlice variable filters out matches that begin with an UPPERCASE). 
```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < emojisArray.length; i++) {
    if(wordSlice === emojisArray[i][0]) {
        return emojisArray[i][1];
    }
}
return wordSlice;
```
Finally, we return the passed-in word If no conditions are met in the if statement.
```javascript
return word; 
```

That was a lot to take in, so let's see the entire completed function.
```javascript
function emojifyWord(word){
        
    const emojisArray = Object.entries(emojis); 
    
    if(word.startsWith(':') && word.endsWith(':')) {
        
        const wordSlice = word.slice(1,-1)
            
        for(let i = 0; i < emojisArray.length; i++) {
            if(wordSlice === emojisArray[i][0]) {
                return emojisArray[i][1];
            }
        }
        return wordSlice;
    } 
    return word;     
}
```

**Function 2**

### Day 14 challenge
#### Count Vowel Consonant
*You are given string s that consists of only lowercase English letters. If vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') are given a value of 1 and consonants are given a value of 2, return the sum of all of the letters in the input string.*

**I solved this challenge using a [for loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) and an [if statement](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp). If the current letter in the loop is a vowel, I add 1; if the current letter in the loop is a consonant, I add 2. I return the total in a variable named counter.**

```javascript
function countVowelConsonant(str) {

  let counter = 0;
  
  for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {

      if(
          str[i] === 'a' ||
          str[i] === 'e' ||
          str[i] === 'i' ||
          str[i] === 'o' ||
          str[i] === 'u' 
          ){
           counter++;   
          } else {
           counter+=2;  
          }
  }
  return counter;
}
```

### Day 15 challenge
#### Palindromes
*Palindromes are words that are the same forward or backward. For example, "noon" and "kayak" are palindromes.*
 
*Write a function to check if a lowercase string of letters is a palindrome. If the word is a palindrome, return true. If it isn't, return false.* 

**We solve this challenge by comparing the string passed-in with the reversed version of the passed-in string. We use the JavaScript methods split, reverse, and join in accomplishing this task.** 
 
Let's take a look one step at a time:

**We first use [split()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp)**
```javascript
const split = str.split('');
    console.log(split);
["p", "u", "m", "p", "k", "i", "n", "s"]
```

**Then we use [reverse()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reverse.asp)**
```javascript
const reverse = split.reverse();
    console.log(reverse);
["s", "n", "i", "k", "p", "m", "u", "p"]
```

**Now we use [join()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp)**
```javascript
const join = reverse.join('');
    console.log(join);  
snikpmup
```
*We can clearly see that the word "pumpkins" is not the same when reversed.*

**To solve the challenge, we can use the [Conditional (Ternary) Operator](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp) to write one succinct line of code to add to the function as follows:**

```javascript
function isPalindrome(str){
  return str === str.split('').reverse().join('') ? true : false;        
}
```

### Day 16 challenge
#### Insert Dashes
*Transform a given sentence into a new one with dashes between each two consecutive letters.*

**Example**
For inputString = "aba caba" the output should be "a-b-a c-a-b-a"

**Hints**
* join()
* split()

At first glance, this challenge seems like it will be solved by simply using join() and split(). However, doing so results in extra dashes, failing the challenge.

```javascript
console.log(arr.split('').join('-'));
a-b-a- -c-a-b-a
```
Although my approach to solving it is not succinct code, it is easy to follow logically. 

**Using a [for each loop()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp), I pass each letter through an [else if](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp) statement that covers all scenarios. I then push each appropriately modified letter into a new array that I [join()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp) and return.**

**Scenarios:**
* The next item is blank
* The current item is blank
* The current item is the last in the array

```javascript
function insertDashes(arr) {
    
    const returnArray = [];
    const splitArray = arr.split('');

    for(let i = 0; i < splitArray.length; i++) {
        
        if(splitArray[i+1] == " ") {
            returnArray.push(`${splitArray[i]}`);
        } else if (splitArray[i] == " "){
            returnArray.push(`${splitArray[i]}`);
        } else if(i === splitArray.length -1){
            returnArray.push(`${splitArray[i]}`);
        } else {
            returnArray.push(`${splitArray[i]}-`);
        }
    }
    return returnArray.join('');
}
result: ,"a-b-a c-a-b-a"
```
