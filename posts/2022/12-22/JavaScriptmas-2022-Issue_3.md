### Intro

Grab your favorite holiday drink, put on some festive music, and get ready to code! 🍹

JavaScriptmas is a 24-day coding challenge event where you can win prizes, regardless of your skill level, by submitting valid solutions and helping others by recording code reviews of their work. 🎄

In this article series, I'm completing each challenge and stepping through and documenting in detail how I solve each one. If you are new to coding or just curious about my solution approach, you may find it helpful for your code-learning journey! 💻

I will also be highlighting others' outstanding works as I come across them during this wonderful festive event! 🎉

### Prize rules

From December 1st to the 24th, new coding challenges will be released daily. All valid solutions submitted in their Discord JavaScriptmas channel act as a raffle ticket. So the more valid solutions you enter, the more chances you have to win! Two winners will be drawn during their YouTube Livestream on December 24th and receive $1000 cash plus a lifetime Scrimba Pro membership!

The first winner will be chosen randomly from the daily coding challenge submissions (on Discord).

The second winner is randomly chosen from their submitted code reviews (on Discord). Each submitted coding review acts as a single raffle ticket, so the more you help others, the more chances you have to win a prize!

***Note:*** *You must enter each daily coding challenge submission by midnight (GMT), and it must be a working solution for your entry to be valid.*

### What are code reviews?

What are the code reviews? A code review is when YOU record a scrim reviewing another person's JavaScriptmas solution, providing constructive feedback.

*For a deep-dive into learning how to create Scrimba screencasts, I wrote this detailed article on the topic: [How to create Scrimba screencasts and turn them into a Scrimba course](https://selftaughttxg.com/2021/02-21/CreateAScrimbaScreencast/)*
