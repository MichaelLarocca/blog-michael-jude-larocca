### Intro

Grab your favorite holiday drink, put on some festive music, and get ready to code! üçπ

JavaScriptmas is a 24-day coding challenge event where you can win prizes, regardless of your skill level, by submitting valid solutions and helping others by recording code reviews of their work. üéÑ

In this article series, I'm completing each challenge and stepping through and documenting in detail how I solve each one. If you are new to coding or just curious about my solution approach, you may find it helpful for your code-learning journey! üíª

I will also be highlighting others' outstanding works as I come across them during this wonderful festive event! üéâ

### Prize rules

From December 1st to the 24th, new coding challenges will be released daily. All valid solutions submitted in their Discord JavaScriptmas channel act as a raffle ticket. So the more valid solutions you enter, the more chances you have to win! Two winners will be drawn during their YouTube Livestream on December 24th and receive $1000 cash plus a lifetime Scrimba Pro membership!

The first winner will be chosen randomly from the daily coding challenge submissions (on Discord).

The second winner is randomly chosen from their submitted code reviews (on Discord). Each submitted coding review acts as a single raffle ticket, so the more you help others, the more chances you have to win a prize!

***Note:*** *You must enter each daily coding challenge submission by midnight (GMT), and it must be a working solution for your entry to be valid.*

### What are code reviews?

What are the code reviews? A code review is when YOU record a scrim reviewing another person's JavaScriptmas solution, providing constructive feedback.

*For a deep-dive into learning how to create Scrimba screencasts, I wrote this detailed article on the topic: [How to create Scrimba screencasts and turn them into a Scrimba course](https://selftaughttxg.com/2021/02-21/CreateAScrimbaScreencast/)*

### Day 12 challenge
#### Breakfast Menu
*Topic: .map()*
*Our restaurant menu currently only shows the breakfast menu,as it has been hard coded into the HTML file. However, we want to offer a dinner menu instead. Let's fix this using .map()*

1. First, fetch a reference to the menu <section> from the DOM. 
2. Set the innerHTML content of the menu <section> to...
3. the dinnerFoods array by mapping over the array and returning the following div for each food in the array: `<div class="food">FOOD VALUE HERE</div>` 
4. Remember to remove any separating commas between the food divs!

**The challenge provides all the HTML and CSS. We just need to write the JavaScript.**

First, we assign the menu variable using [getElementById()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_getelementbyid.asp) as follows:
```javascript
const menu = document.getElementById("menu");
```

Now let's take a look at the HTML `<div>` the challenge asks us to create:
```html
<div class="food">FOOD VALUE HERE</div>
```

**To solve the challenge, we will use [map()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp) as instructed, and we will use string interpolation to replace "FOOD VALUE HERE" for each item in the dinner foods array, using [join()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp) to remove the commas.**
```javascript
menu.innerHTML = dinnerFoods.map(item => `<div class="food">${item}</div>`).join('');
```

### Day 15 challenge
#### Palindromes
*Palindromes are words that are the same forward or backward. For example, "noon" and "kayak" are palindromes.*
 
*Write a function to check if a lowercase string of letters is a palindrome. If the word is a palindrome, return true. If it isn't, return false.* 

**We solve this challenge by comparing the string passed-in with the reversed version of the passed-in string. We use the JavaScript methods split, reverse, and join in accomplishing this task.** 
 
Let's take a look one step at a time:

**We first use [split()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp)**
```javascript
const split = str.split('');
    console.log(split);
["p", "u", "m", "p", "k", "i", "n", "s"]
```

**Then we use [reverse()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reverse.asp)**
```javascript
const reverse = split.reverse();
    console.log(reverse);
["s", "n", "i", "k", "p", "m", "u", "p"]
```

**Now we use [join()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp)**
```javascript
const join = reverse.join('');
    console.log(join);  
snikpmup
```
*We can clearly see that the word "pumpkins" is not the same when reversed.*

**To solve the challenge, we can use the [Conditional (Ternary) Operator](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp) to write one succinct line of code to add to the function as follows:**

```javascript
function isPalindrome(str){
  return str === str.split('').reverse().join('') ? true : false;        
}
```

### Day 16 challenge
#### Insert Dashes
*Transform a given sentence into a new one with dashes between each two consecutive letters.*

**Example**
For inputString = "aba caba" the output should be "a-b-a c-a-b-a"

**Hints**
* join()
* split()

At first glance, this challenge seems like it will be solved by simply using join() and split(). However, doing so results in extra dashes, failing the challenge.

```javascript
console.log(arr.split('').join('-'));
a-b-a- -c-a-b-a
```
Although my approach to solving it is not succinct code, it is easy to follow logically. 

**Using a [for each loop()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp), I pass each letter through an [else if](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp) statement that covers all scenarios. I then push each appropriately modified letter into a new array that I [join()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp) and return.**

**Scenarios:**
* The next item is blank
* The current item is blank
* The current item is the last in the array

```javascript
function insertDashes(arr) {
    
    const returnArray = [];
    const splitArray = arr.split('');

    for(let i = 0; i < splitArray.length; i++) {
        
        if(splitArray[i+1] == " ") {
            returnArray.push(`${splitArray[i]}`);
        } else if (splitArray[i] == " "){
            returnArray.push(`${splitArray[i]}`);
        } else if(i === splitArray.length -1){
            returnArray.push(`${splitArray[i]}`);
        } else {
            returnArray.push(`${splitArray[i]}-`);
        }
    }
    return returnArray.join('');
}
result: ,"a-b-a c-a-b-a"
```
