### Prize rules

From December 1st to the 24th, new coding challenges will be released daily. All valid solutions submitted in their Discord JavaScriptmas channel act as a raffle ticket. So the more valid solutions you enter, the more chances you have to win! Two winners will be drawn during their YouTube Livestream on December 24th and receive $1000 cash plus a lifetime Scrimba Pro membership!

The first winner will be chosen randomly from the daily coding challenge submissions (on Discord).

The second winner is randomly chosen from their submitted code reviews (on Discord). Each submitted coding review acts as a single raffle ticket, so the more you help others, the more chances you have to win a prize!

***Note:*** *You must enter each daily coding challenge submission by midnight (GMT), and it must be a working solution for your entry to be valid.*

### Day 5 challenge
#### Candy Sale
*It's the day after Halloween üéÉ and all the candy is on sale!*

*To buy up all the candy, use map() and filter() to put all the candy into a 'shoppingCart' array.* 

*The new array should contain only the item and the price, like this:*
```javascript
Expected output: 
[
    {item: "üç≠", price: 2.99},
    {item: "üç´", price: 1.99}, 
    {item: "üç¨", price: 0.89}
]
```    

**This challenge instructs us to solve it using filter() and map().**

The [filter()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_filter.asp) method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.

With [map()](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp), we can perform an action on each element in a collection and then gather the results into a new array.

Let's take a look at just the first record in the products array to see what we are working with:

```javascript
console.log(products[0]);
{item: "üç≠", price: 2.99, type: "sweet"}
```

So, first, we need to check each record (object) in the products array to see if its value for type equals sweet. Using filter, we can set just these records to a new array declared "filterProducts" as follows:
```javascript
const filterProducts = products.filter(product => product.type === "sweet");
```

We can console logs to see the results: 
```javascript
console.log(filterProducts);
[{item: "üç≠", price: 2.99, type: "sweet"}, {item: "üç´", price: 1.99, type: "sweet"}, {item: "üç¨", price: 0.89, type: "sweet"}]
```

Now, let's see how map works separately. We will use map to return a new array declared "mapProducts," with only the key-value pairs introduced by the challenge as follows:
```javascript
const mapProducts = products.map(product => ({item: product.item, price: product.price})); 
```

We can console logs to see the results of using map: 
```javascript
console.log(mapProducts);
[{item: "üç≠", price: 2.99}, {item: "üç´", price: 1.99}, {item: "ü•´", price: 1.99}, {item: "üç¨", price: 0.89}, {item: "ü•¶", price: 3.99}, {item: "üçñ", price: 3.99}]
```

Great! We got both filter and map working separately. Now, before we write a function to solve the challenge, let's see how we can chain both methods to get the results we want:  
```javascript
const chain = products.filter(product => product.type === "sweet").map(product => ({item: product.item, price: product.price})); 
```

Once again, let's see the results by using a console log:
```javascript
console.log(chain);
[{item: "üç≠", price: 2.99}, {item: "üç´", price: 1.99}, {item: "üç¨", price: 0.89}]
```

Now that we know how to use the filter and map methods, we can write a function to solve the challenge. By chaining the methods, we can create a new array declared "shoppingCart" with one succinct line of code.
```javascript
function getSaleItems(products){
    
    const shoppingCart = products.filter(product => product.type === "sweet").map(product =>({item: product.item, price: product.price}));

    return shoppingCart;
};
```
