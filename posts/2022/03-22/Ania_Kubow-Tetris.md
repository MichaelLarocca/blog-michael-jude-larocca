### Ania Kubow's Completed Game

Ania Kubow's Tetris JavaScript tutorial is brilliant, and I can highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning JavaScript.

Not only do you learn how to make a game to add to your portfolio, you learn fundamental JavaScript programming in a fun and engaging way!

The simplicity of the Tetris JavaScript project allows you to create a working game rather quickly and leaves plenty of room for customization, which I took to the max!

***Note:*** *There is a known issue of rotating the Tetrominoes at the edge of the board; half of the rotated Tetromino displays on both the left and right edges of the gameboard.*

*This issue was addressed by Ania and can be resolved by adding additional code found in her GitHub repo.*
