### EP 1 - Breaking into big tech w/ Dylan Israel

Dylan Israel is the first guest on the new MentorCruise Podcast, and the topic is "**Breaking into big tech**."

During the Podcast, Dylan discusses his path to success as a self-taught developer, from his humble beginnings to landing his first job at a "**FAANG**" company. 

*(* ***FAANG:*** *Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google)*

---

*"It took four years to be an overnight success!"*

> -Dylan Israel

Humble Beginnings

Like many people, Dylan chose to go to college because it was the typical path. Admittedly, Dylan only gave college a "half effort" because he wasn't happy there.

Dylan decided to drop out of college to pursue becoming a software engineer on his own. He describes his first job in tech as "a cross between a business analyst and a technical writer." He worked 50 hours a week.

Continuing his education, Dylan spent a lot of time taking coding courses from online schools; Dylan cites [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

While learning with these online schools, Dylan created his own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/pizzapokerguy87), where he documents and teaches what he is learning. 

---

"*I just wanted an interesting side project that would catch people's eyes, and maybe I could make some money in the best-case scenario."*

> -Dylan Israel

**Many people found Dylan's resourceful and inspirational YouTube channel and coded along with him, including me!**

### How Dylan landed a job at Amazon

Dylan worked at [Price Waterhouse Cooper](https://www.pwc.com/), a big company, but not a big tech company. He credits all of his "**passion projects**" in drawing the attention of tech recruiters.

---

*"For the recruiters to reach out, they have to say, 'Hey, maybe this person knows what they are doing and is a very passionate engineer, and let us give him a shot.' Right?"*

> -Dylan Israel

---

**Dylan secured an interview at Amazon through a recruiter that reached out to him. Two weeks after the interview, Amazon hired Dylan.**
