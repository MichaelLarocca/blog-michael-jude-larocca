### Work Experience

As a developer trying to land your first job in tech, how can you apply for a job that requires work experience when you don't have work experience?

**Alex provides us with viable options for supplemental work experience to satisfy this work experience requirement.**

* Internships
* Freelancing

### Freelancing

(WRITE ARTICLE SECTION)

Alex tells us that freelancing counts as work experience to your resume.

Here is an important note about stating you're a **freelancer**. In a previous [LinkedIn review article I wrote](https://selftaughttxg.com/2021/05-21/LinkedInReviewWithDannyThompson/), Danny Thompson explains that people **unintentionally** falsify their work experience by stating that they are freelancers.

Danny Thompson explains there is a distinct difference between being a **freelancer** and being a **student**.

When you state that you are a freelancer, hiring managers want to see receipts, Meaning you were paid for your work.

### Certificates

Although Alex does not have any certificates, he tells us if you do not have a traditional form of education such as a college degree, certificates are really good to have as an alternative.

Again referencing my previous [LinkedIn review article I wrote](https://selftaughttxg.com/2021/05-21/LinkedInReviewWithDannyThompson/), Danny Thompson explains that certifications that are taken at test centers such as Amazon (AWS) & Google certifications will be acknowledged by hiring managers. However, online certifications earned from home are more for our own growth and personal achievements.
