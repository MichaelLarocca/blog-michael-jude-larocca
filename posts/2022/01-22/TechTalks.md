### Episode 2

#### Matthew Smith

In episode two, we are introduced to **Matthew Smith**. Like many of us, including myself, Matthew wants to land his first job in tech as a career changer.

Matthew Smith has spent many years as a professional chef in the foodservice industry. He describes the long hours he worked and how he believes the restaurant business model is broken. Matthew elaborates that the markup and the pay are low in the restaurant model, resulting in many businesses closing down shortly after the government enforced restrictions due to the pandemic.

Matthew is currently working as a freelance developer. Yet, he explains that the work, including the pay, is sporadic, and he does not enjoy the interpersonal business aspects of freelancing. Matthew would like a full-time steady job as a developer, where he can primarily focus on programming.

However, Matthew's current attempts at "**getting his foot in the door**" as a developer have proven difficult.

**Then during the Tech Talks episode, Chris Miller brings in an unannounced speaker to help Matthew, "tech celebrity" Danny Thompson!**

**During the Tech Talks episode, Danny Thompson expresses the importance of having a strong LinkedIn profile,  which will significantly enhance our chances of getting our foot into the tech industry door.**

Danny Thompson informs us that hiring managers have a different version of LinkedIn than we as users do. When hiring managers search for candidates, the information we put in our LinkedIn "**Headline**" shows up in the results. For example, my current LinkedIn Headline is: **(Front-End Web Developer | JavaScript | CSS | HTML)**.

**Also, Danny explains it is essential for us to list the job we want, not our current job.** In addition to listing the job you want, you will also want to list your skills in your LinkedIn "**Headline**," as I previously described.
