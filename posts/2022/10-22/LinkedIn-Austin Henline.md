Austin explains that nowadays, having a LinkedIn profile is equally important as having a resume. On a personal note, Austin tells us out of the first 24 jobs he applied to, all of them requested a LinkedIn profile as part of the application process, which he did not have then.

Since then, Austin has created an exceptional LinkedIn profile that has attracted over 300 job offers. He now works at LinkedIn and has trained career advisers, businesses, universities, and non-profits on improving their LinkedIn strategies.

*"95% of recruiters use LinkedIn to find talent these days."*

**During his TEDx talk presentation,  Austin provides us with four steps to help us establish our professional brand and set ourselves apart from the rest:**

1. Define your purpose and your target audience
2. Demand attention with your headline
3. Create your own content
4. Recognize and nurture your skills

**Define your purpose and your target audience**

Before you can find success on LinkedIn, you need to define why you want to use the platform.

**Are you:**

* Looking for a job.
* A business owner looking to hire
* Looking for customers
* Grow your network
* Looking for a career change

Once you define what you are using the platform for, you will know your target audience. With your target audience in mind, you can best optimize your LinkedIn profile.

*"By stating the value that you bring to people, rather than making them spend their time trying to figure out how you benefit them, then you'll Attract a greater number of your target audience."*

**Demand attention with your headline**

If you do not create a headline, LinkedIn defaults your headline to display your work position at the company you work. If you are a student who is not working, LinkedIn defaults your headline to display you as a student at the university you are attending.

*90% of LinkedIn profiles use the default headline. By creating a headline, you will optimize your LinkedIn profile significantly.*

**Demand attention with your headline by:**

* Stating the benefit you provide for your target audience
* Including your current position
* Including skills that you have  

Optimizing your headline will not only give others an idea of who you are at a glance, but your profile will show up in more searches due to the keywords included in your headline.

**Create content**

Only 1% of LinkedIn members create content. Not only will you stand out significantly as a content creator, but influential people will likely discover you!

**Recognize and nurture your skills**

Recognize your skills, nurture them, and turn them into your personal brand. Your personal brand will become a catalyst that will continuously open up doors of opportunities for you!

**Following Austin's four optimization steps of defining your target audience, demanding attention with your headline, creating content, and developing your skills will help you to stand out on LinkedIn.**

***In the following detailed article sections below, Austin Henline advises us on how to optimize our LinkedIn profile.***

---

### Headline
**The headline section provides an opportunity to briefly describe who you are, what you currently do, and what you seek. You will want to make sure that you adequately provide this information succinctly. Think of it similar to a resume that only gets an eight-second glance!**

The headline section is also the section searched for keywords.

**When recruiters and employers search LinkedIn for people with specific skills, the keywords they enter match keywords found in the profiles headline section.** 

*For example, if you are a Front-End Developer and include that text in your headline, your profile will appear in searches that include Front-End Developer. However, you will not appear in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML searches if you do not also have those keywords in your headline!* 

**You can optimize your LinkedIn headline section by:**

* Describing who you are, what you currently do, and what you seek.
* Using each of your skills as keywords for searches.
* Utilizing the entire 220-character limit.
* Saving headline characters by alternatively using the "Open to work" banner.

***Tip:*** *You can use the only "let recruiters know" option if you do not wish to display the "open-to-work banner" for everyone to view.*

### Cover photo
Austin tells us if we are not using a cover photo on our LinkedIn profile, it is a lost opportunity. Not only will it gain the attention of viewers, but it will also provide them with a picture of who you are.

If you are a public speaker, you can use a picture of yourself publicly speaking. If you are a web developer, you could include the icons of what you use, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**You can create a cover photo using free resources, such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and you can use license-free pictures and images from sites, such as [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).**

If designing a cover photo is not your thing, you can pay someone else to create it. I paid for mine using [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/).

***Tip:*** *Adding contact information on your cover photo will give recruiters a way to reach you without using their limited InMail message credits.*

### About section
After plenty of research and having my LinkedIn portfolio reviewed three times, there seem to be different opinions on what belongs in the about section. Some advise it to be long and detailed, some recommend it to be short and sweet, and others suggest it to be somewhere in the middle.  

**Austin proposes we provide five paragraphs in our LinkedIn about section that include the following:**

1. A hook
2. Your past
3. Your present
4. Your Future
5. Your skills

**A hook**

For the first paragraph, write something catchy that will entice the reader. Share some personality, and tell your story.

**Your past**

In the second paragraph, write about where you have been and what you have done.

**Your present**

In this paragraph, write about what you are currently doing. What is your job? Do you enjoy it?

**Your Future**

What career aspirations do you have? What are you interested in doing? Write about these topics in this paragraph.

**Your skills**

In the last paragraph, provide a list of skills that you have. Doing so will help you appear in searches and allow recruiters and employers to see your skills at a glance without having to look deeper into your profile.

---

*Note: If you are copying information from your resume into your about section,  be consistent throughout your LinkedIn profile when writing in the first or third person. For example, if you write, "Michael writes articles for both his website and others," and then in your experience section, "I have two years of experience writing articles," it would be inconsistent. Austin advises us to write in the first person for our LinkedIn profile.*

---

### Experience section
In the experience section, there is an opportunity to optimize your profile by adding details to each of your experience titles.

**Consider adding bullet points to elaborate on your experience titles, similar to bullet points you may have on your resume. You can even talk about your accomplishments in each of these sections.**

*As it may be tempting to include all of our work experience, Austin advises us only to include the experience that is relevant to the jobs we are currently seeking.*

### For college students without experience
If you are currently in college or recently graduated, you may not have work experience.

**As a viable alternative to work experience, you can highlight your:**

* Volunteer experience
* Club experiences
* Projects

In your LinkedIn experience section, you can talk about any volunteer experience, club experiences, and projects you created. You can even display your projects in your LinkedIn profile's projects section!
