### Dev Tools

Shashi uses the dev tools built into the Google Chrome browser to inspect and optimize his projects as part of his regular workflow.

*"Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser."*

> -[Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)

---

**Chrome DevTools provides:**

* Performance check
* Accessibility
* SEO
* And more!

Shashi teaches us that our website's performance (Google page ranking) is based on the mobile layout score. That is now one more reason for us to design our websites with a "mobile-first" approach.

***To learn more about the Google Chrome DevTools, you can read my article "[Web Accessibility 101 - with Carie Fisher](https://selftaughttxg.com/2021/07-21/WebAccessibility101-WithCarieFisher/)" where I used it to audit my blog website!***

**Another tool that Shashi uses is [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/).**

Shashi tells us that he does an 80% compression on his website jpegs, and he also removes the metadata behind the jpegs. 

After running this procedure, he saves about 20% in image file space, resulting in a huge increase in the website's performance!

### How do you stay updated on trends?

Shashi wisely suggests that we follow resourceful content creators on Twitter to stay updated on trends.

**Shashi explains that he doesn't have the time and luxury to "deep dive" into new topics and trends, so he learns about them from other talented creators that keep us informed.**

Shashi cites Kevin Powell ([@KevinJPowell](https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell)) and Jhey ([@jh3yy](https://twitter.com/jh3yy)) as his resources.

***After Shashi's shoutout to "Jhey" during the Livestream, from chats on Twitter, it looks like a new Scrimba GreenSock course taught by Jhey could be in the works!***
