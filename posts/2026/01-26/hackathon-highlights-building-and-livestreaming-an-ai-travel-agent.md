### Hackathon AI Agent Challenge

To kick off 2026 and continue my self-taught developer journey, I’m once again joining Shashi Lo’s Gridiron Survivor team—an apprenticeship program that gives devs hands-on, pro-level experience. This time, we're taking on a hackathon challenge to build an AI agent!

The hackathon features two rival teams competing to develop an AI-powered travel agent app, sponsored by GitKraken, Frontend Mentor, and Zephyr Cloud. Up for grabs: a $1000 cash prize, one-year free memberships, and plenty of swag! This hackathon is underway now and will continue into February (and may extend if additional time is needed).  

While it’s a contest, the real win for everyone is the shared learning experience, the sense of team camaraderie, and—my favorite—the chance to keep building an online presence.

*On a personal note, I’m especially excited for this hackathon because my nephew* [*David Terzano*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-terzano-b15657329?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app)*—fresh out of college with a degree in computer science and a passion for game development—is joining my team! This event gives* [*David*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-terzano-b15657329?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app) *and all participants real-world team experience to help close the gap that new devs face when seeking their first roles. I can’t wait to see him jump in, learn with us, and bring fresh ideas to the project!*

### AI Agent, Travel Agent

The challenge is to build a travel agent app powered by a specialized AI agent that serves as the core of our hackathon project. A successful AI travel agent should efficiently integrate with multiple APIs to provide accurate travel information, automatically suggest itineraries, and personalize travel plans based on user preferences. Our desired outcome includes robust handling of user queries and consistent performance under various use-case scenarios.

* **Speed:** Each team chooses its own tech stack, which enables efficient development and performance optimization to meet specific project demands.
    
* **Flexibility**: Micro front-end architecture enables modular development, making it easier to update sections of the app independently.
    
* **Integration:** API integrations are key to the app pulling real-time travel data and resources, ensuring accurate, timely information.
    
* **Intelligence:** Custom AI models are used to analyze user data and preferences, providing personalized travel suggestions and enhancing the user’s experience.
    

*These features and more highlight the complexity and potential of our AI travel agent app!*

### Livestream Presentations

To truly level up like the pros, team members will be hosting live presentations. Taking the floor to present, demo, and field questions is a valuable skill in itself, especially when navigating inevitable technical difficulties.

As a first step to engage with our journey, subscribe to the [Coding with Shashi](https://www.youtube.com/@codingwithshashi) YouTube channel and turn on notifications to stay updated on all events. This ensures you won't miss any opportunities to follow along, ask questions, and provide feedback live.
