### Florin Pop's Intro 

Florin starts off the Livestream by telling us how he got his start in the tech field.

Florin explains that he had some experience when he was younger but credited 2013 as the year he started.

In 2013 he acquired work through the website "[freelancer.com](https://www.freelancer.com/)."

At that time, he saw projects of various sizes available and was hired by one after he applied to several.

The project that he took on was was a coding gig to convert a design into HTML and CSS.

Since Florin was attending school at the time, he was not under pressure to make money as a freelancer, but he tells us that the experience opened up a lot of possibilities for him.

### Invest in yourself

Florin teaches us that the best investment that we can make in tech is to invest in ourselves.

**To learn and develop his skills, Florin has:**

* Purchased courses
* Hired mentors
* Joined communities
* Joined programs
* Bought books

---

***Florin noted that he did not limit his learning to the tech field; he also expanded the areas of study to include finance and personal development.***

---

A turning point for Florin was the advice he was given by a person conducting one of his interviews. The constructive criticism that he received was that "**he needed to learn how to sell himself**." He was advised to sell himself by talking about what he knows well and what value he can provide.

When it comes to promoting ourselves, Florin advises trying multiple platforms and utilizing what works best for us on an individual basis:

* Facebook
* Instagram
* Twitter
* LinkedIn

---

### LinkedIn

Florin reveals his largest paid projects were sourced by people reaching out to him through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).

He made an effort to attain "**500+**" connections on LinkedIn and made sure they included recruiters, CEOs, and other developers.

The host, [Leane](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcVIHAWGsOndLoxm9GEe03g), brings to everyone's attention that Danny Thompson also recommended us to attain "**500+**" connections on LinkedIn in a recent Scimba Livestream event.

My LinkedIn profile was reviewed in this Livestream, and I documented it in my "[LinkedIn Review with Danny Thompson](https://selftaughttxg.com/2021/05-21/LinkedInReviewWithDannyThompson/)" article.

### Blogging

Florin advises developers to blog. He explains to us that we should start by simply documenting what we are learning.

We should start by documenting new programming concepts, such as CSS flexbox and grid.

When we develop our skills and have a better understanding of such topics, we should then write a blog to explain them in detail to someone else. Writing an article with this approach will make you both a better developer and blogger.

In time, Florin started to receive requests to start writing for other publications.

**For his first paid article, Florin was offered approximately fifty dollars. Soon afterward, he was offered three hundred and then five hundred dollars.**

Florin learned how to earn money by writing articles through this experience and realized blogging to be a viable source of income.

During this Livestream section, Florin tells us about an article he recently read that provided twenty publications that will pay you to write articles for them. He suggests that we reach out to such publications to inquire about paid work.

---

**Florin also addresses the cliche question,** *"why should I blog about topics that other writers already cover?"* He insightfully explains that our writing will resonate with specific groups of people due to our style and our current level of programming experience.

Florin concludes by instructing us to create a blogging schedule that works for us and to be consistent with releasing the articles.

**For additional ways to earn money by blogging, Florin suggests adding:**

* Ads
* Affiliate links
* Advertise your products and services

However, another video idea he had ended up annoying his followers. The annoyance was due to "too much content" released in too short of a time.

**Florin teaches us from his experience to keep trying out new ideas and not trouble ourselves by anticipating which ones will work.**
