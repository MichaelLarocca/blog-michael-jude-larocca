### What is The Advice Hub

The Advice Hub is a new dedicated platform created by Ayodele Samuel Adebayo for developers to exchange valuable advice with each other in one place.

***Necessity is the mother of invention***

*From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_is_the_mother_of_invention): "Necessity is the mother of invention" is a well-known proverb. It means, roughly, that the primary driving force for most new inventions is a need.*

---

### Inspiration for the creation of The Advice Hub

A few months after Ayodele started learning JavaScript, he created a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayodele-samuel-ayodele-55902819a/) account and started a personal blog on [Hashnode](https://unclebigbay.com/).

Ayodele wanted to learn how to build genuine connections on social media platforms like Linkedin and Twitter rather than simply being an ordinary follower. He also wanted to learn how to grow his blog, freelance, and build his personal brand.

To achieve his goals, Ayodele needed guidance and advice from his web developer peers. However, he found the information he required challenging to attain.

***"As a newbie, I needed a lot of help and advice in a variety of categories."***

> -*Ayodele Samuel Adebayo*

---

Ayodele realized that every developer, through their personal experiences, has learned valuable lessons along their journey.

The lessons learned by developers include what worked for them and what did not work for them as they advanced in the tech field.

However, Ayodele discerned that developers do not viably exchange the insightful lessons they learned; They often ask for and share helpful advice through tweets and posts, which are cumbersome to track and access.

**To resolve this issue, Ayodele envisioned a centralized place for developers to exchange knowledge in the form of cards. Having such a place will enable developers to ask for and share advice.**

---

***"The goal of the project is to establish a platform where developers may ask for or create advice in the form of cards for other developers to answer or learn from."***

### How The Advice Hub Works

To participate on The Advice Hub, you need to log in with Auth0. You can create an Advice Hub account via e-mail and password, or you can log in with a Google Account.

***You are still welcome to view the advice cards without logging in.***

On the Advice Hub, each user has a profile that displays all of the advice cards they created along with a "**Total Advice Given**" total.

### Network Building with The 3 P's

* Be present
* Pay Attention
* Participate

To build and grow your network, It is in your best interest to find events to attend. Be **present** at Twitter Spaces, LiveStreams, MeetUps, and similar networking events.

When attending networking events, **pay attention**. Listen and learn the topics discussed.

Finally, at the networking events your attending, **participate**. Make your presence known by asking on-topic questions add your thoughts and advice, and after the event, thank the people that hosted the event.

**Build your network by sending invitations to the hosts and other participants of the events you attend. They are more likely to accept your invitation if you are "present,"  "paid attention," and "Participated."**

### Why the Advice Hub is remarkable

Ayodele observed a gap between those who need advice and those who are willing to share it.

He also proves the point that everyone, at every level, has valuable advice to share with the community.

Finally, Ayodele presents a persuasive argument that developers do not viably share advice in a manner that is easy to reference.

Thanks to Ayodele, the community now has a viable centralized place to ask for and provide advice, ultimately benefiting everyone.
