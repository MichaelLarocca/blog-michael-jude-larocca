### Introduction

In this Scrimba Podcast, host Alex Booker inquires from Erik, "his streamlined and specific advice on how he would approach getting a developer job today!"

---

### About Erik

Erik currently works today as a Front End Engineer at Amazon Web Services.

He has a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and an M.B.A. in Entrepreneurship from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/).

Erik is also the co-creator and co-host of my favorite Podcast, [Self-Taught or Not](https://www.selftaughtornot.com/)!

---

### Interviewing

**Erik tells us that interviewing is a skill that we have to get good at.**

Rejection is inevitable, and it is something that we need to get better at handling. Erik says not to take rejection personally. 

The strategy and advice that Erik gives, "**take notes**."

**Take notes of:**

* The questions asked
* What went well and what did not
* The feedback given after the interview

### Take advantage of amazing resources

Scrimba Podcast host Alex asks Erik, *"If you were looking for a junior developer role today, what strategy would you employ?"*

If Erik was a junior dev today, he tells us that he would first take advantage of all of the amazing modern resources available.

**Amazing resources**

* Scrimba
* FreeCodeCamp
* YouTube tutorials

Erik explains to us that he will utilize these free resources until he can "**talk intelligently about these technologies**" and "**create websites**."

---

### Applying for jobs

Erik tells us there's a lot of competition and that **we need to stand out**, even to land an interview.

Erik explains the two approaches he has seen, "**the spray and pray**" method and the "**the networking**" method.

The spray and pray method is to send out hundreds of resumes applying to hundreds of jobs.

**Erik prefers the networking approach where you narrow down 10 to 15 jobs that you really want and then see if there's a way you can network with the people at those jobs.**

**Ways you can network**

* Going to meetups
* LinkedIn
* Twitter

Erik advises us to research and learn about the company's you want to work for and then reach out to the employees at that company.

**Be upfront with the people you are trying to network with, and do not be deceiving.**

Erik recommends introducing ourselves, letting them know we are interested in employment at that company, and referring them to our public work.

---

### Working in public

Now Erik brings up the topic that seems to keep arising in all of my recruitment-related articles, working in public!

"**Another approach**," Erik tells us, "**There's this idea that you can work in public.**"

**Working in public**

* Content creation
* Social networking
* Personal branding

---

**Content creation**

Content creation can be YouTube videos, blog posts, courses, or other means of teaching/documenting what you are learning.

---

**Social networking**

You can share your created content on social networks, such as Twitter, Linked In, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

---

**Personal branding**

In time, you will develop your personal brand by creating content and sharing it on social networks.

Having an **online presence** through **content creation**, **social networking**, and **personal branding** helps us stand out from the crowd and provides many opportunities!

### Which framework/Library should you learn?

**The consensus is clear; it does not matter which framework or library you choose to learn.**

At the time of writing this article, React is the most popular and taught as part of most curriculums.

**Erik makes a profound statement when he advises us to research local companies, find out the framework/tech stack they are using, and then learn it!**

Erik further advises us to create blog posts/projects with the technology used at the companies we want to work for, publicly display them, and then share them on our social networks, tagging the company and its employees.

---

***"Try to get on their radar,"*** Erik tells us, ***"follow them back, and then see who responds. You might be able to get ahold of a hiring manager"***

---

### Completing courses

When it comes to hiring junior developers, Erik tells us, *"to see someone that has the potential to learn is great!"*

Erik continues, *"Having completed courses from Scrimba or freeCodeCamp or some of these other places is great to see because then you know they've learned these things themselves."*

---

**After completing courses and earning certificates, you can display them on your LinkedIn, share them on your social networks, add them to your resume and GitHub.**

---

### Get a little better every day

Erik encourages us to "**get a little better every day**."

Erik gives a fantastic analogy during the Livestream; he compares the approach to learning to code to the approach to hiking.

There is a hiking trail that Erik enjoys. He tells us when he first started, he could make it about half a mile before getting winded.

Then day by day, he made it a little bit further. After a few weeks, Erik was capable of making it to four miles.

When learning how to code, we start by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Then we realize that there is a lot more to learn, and we may become overwhelmed.

**Erik encourages us to learn incrementally to get a little better every day.**
