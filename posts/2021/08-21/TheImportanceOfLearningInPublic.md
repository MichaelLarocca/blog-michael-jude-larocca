### How to get started learning & building in public

James tells us that it is common for developers to "**not know what to write about**" when they want to start learning & building in public.

James answers this common question with this perceptive question, ***"what is the last thing that you learned?"***

**Write about**

* Problems you solved
* Things you learned
* Projects you already built
* Projects you would like to build
* Share what you learn along the way

**By writing about what you are learning, not only are you helping others, you are creating documentation for yourself to reference in the future.**

### Why would they learn from you

**Amy and James tell us that the most qualified person to teach a topic is someone who just learned that topic.**

As you are a student learning topics and documenting them, other students will relate to you and how you teach them better, then they would relate to an experienced developer who teaches by theory, rules, and documentation.

Amy and James also explain that experienced developers, such as themselves, sometimes struggle in relating to and instructing students learning from scratch because it's been so long since they were beginners.

*"If you're the person who just learned something, you're the best person to understand what it's like to learn that thing, and now you can translate that to something that other people can benefit from."*

### How & where you can learn in public

<!-- **Hashnode** -->

James recommends the blogging platform **[Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)**. You can set up an account for free, and he is impressed with the work that they have done and the community they have built.

Hashnode has a "**built-in audience**," which will help you to get exposure. They also allow you to republish your articles on their website, and Hashnode promotes articles they like!

***Hashnode promoted the very first article that I published on their site!***

### Twitter

James also recommends [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) as a great place to learn in public. When you learn something new, James tells us to send a tweet about it. You will have a history of what you learned, and then you can read them later and even write a blog post about the topics you discussed.

Twitter also has a great "**Tech Community!**" Connecting with like-minded people who support you is a great way to stay encouraged while learning in public.

**With Twitter, you can:**

* Learn from others tweets
* Attend Twitter Spaces
* Participate in 100 Days of Code

---

### Accountability

**To receive the benefits that come along with learning in public, you must commit to documenting your work with consistency.**

A great way to commit to learning in public is to take on the Twitter **#100DaysOfCode** challenge.

**[Alex Kallaway](https://twitter.com/ka11away)** created the 100 days of code challenge as a "**light-weight challenge**" and a way to hold yourself accountable by committing to a code learning schedule.

### Benefits of learning & building in public

By learning and building in public, you create an online presence that demonstrates your commitment to learning to potential employers, clients, and colleagues and provides a portfolio of work that showcases your skills.

**Having an online presence gives you visibility that can lead to many opportunities. It will also help you to stand out from other developers, giving you a competitive advantage.**

### Conclusion

By learning in public, we create an online presence for ourselves, giving us a competitive advantage that can lead us to various opportunities.

Creating online content, such as blog articles, tutorial videos, and Podcasts, will put us in the spotlight, exposing us to both positive and negative feedback.

When receiving feedback, if we receive constructive criticism, it becomes a learning experience for us. If we are just being "Trolled," we must not get discouraged; we need to learn how to deal with these types of situations better and grow a "thick skin."

**When it comes to being criticized, James Quick said it best,** *"Either there is a learning opportunity for you or not. If there is not a learning opportunity for you, completely ignore it."*
