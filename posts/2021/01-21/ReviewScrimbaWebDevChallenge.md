### What is Scrimba's Weekly Web Dev Challenge?

The Weekly Web Dev Challenge is a free email course delivered directly to your inbox every Wednesday.

Making commitments to code is a great way to create a steady schedule to practice programming, and taking part in Scrimba's Weekly Web Dev Challenges is a fun way to learn and share your code!

**Here is a list of my previous Weekly Web Dev Challenge submissions**:

### How I Wired it 

To simplify the process, I copied the already created HTML IDs and used them as JavaScript variables.

```javascript
const original_currency_amount = document.getElementById("original-currency-amount").value;
const original_currency_unit = document.getElementById("original-currency-unit").value;
const new_currency_unit = document.getElementById("new-currency-unit").value;
    
const exchange_rate = document.getElementById("exchange-rate").value;   
const output_text = document.getElementById("output-text");
```

I then calculated the exchange rate by multiplying the **currency amount** by the **exchange rate**.

I used JavaScripts "**ToFixed(2)**" method, rounding the number to keep only two decimals. 

```javascript
    const er = original_currency_amount * exchange_rate;
    const erToFixed = er.toFixed(2);
```

I also added default values to the HTML IDs:

```html
<input type="number" id="original-currency-amount" placeholder="1" value="1"></input>
<input type="text" id="original-currency-unit" placeholder="USD" value="USD"></input> 

<input type="text" id="new-currency-unit" placeholder="EURO" value="EURO"></input>
<input type="number" id="exchange-rate" placeholder="0.822219" value="0.822219"></input>
```

I Then created a function called "ER()" to run when the button is clicked.

```html
<button onclick="ER()">Exchange my money now!</button>
```

Finally, I printed the output.

```javascript
output_text.innerHTML = `Your $${original_currency_amount} ${original_currency_unit} will currently buy you $${erToFixed} ${new_currency_unit}`
```

***Writing the program this way makes it flexible for the user to change the inputted variables and get the desired exchange rate conversions.***

**Agent Tip:**

*Document your work! Along your code learning journey, you will solve many issues. Properly documenting them will give you a valuable resource to reference*.

### How I Styled It

**Background Blend Mode**

In previous projects, I researched and resolved how to "dim/fade" a background image. Using this setting on a background image makes the foreground text clearer and easier to read while providing a nice background.

Here is the code needed to produce this effect:
```css
	background-blend-mode: overlay;
```

When using the "background-blend-mode," the assigned background color is blended with the background image.

For my project, I assigned the background color to black using "rgba(0,0,0,0.5)". I set the "alpha" to "0.5," which, in conjunction with the "background-blend-mode," produced the  "dim/fade" effect I desired.


```css
    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
    background-image: url(https://images.pexels.com/photos/534216/pexels-photo-534216.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940);
```

---

**Button**

I used the classic "change color/cursor pointer" on hover and focus.
I also added a border and a nice font shadow to make the text more readable.

```css
button:hover,
button:focus {
    border: 3px solid white;
    background-color: orange;
    color: white;
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black;
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

---

**(DTTAH) Don't Try This at Home** 

I imported a Google Font for the project. 

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bodoni+Moda:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
To get the font working, I used my makeshift principle of coding I aptly titled "**DTTAH**." I hastily copied and pasted the font code all over the place to quickly complete and submit my project. This method completely disobeys the "**DRY**" principle of coding, which is "Don't Repeat Yourself!"

```css
	font-family: 'Bodoni Moda', serif; 
```

You might ask, "Agent TXG-007, why did you not refactor the code? Over." 

To which I would frantically reply, "Negative! Negative! There is no time to refactor the code! Scrimba's Web Dev competition already took off!"

**Scrimba tells us that publicly displaying our work is great for building our personal brand and gives us something to show off in coding interviews in the future.**

**I believe it is a big personal step to create a blog and to put yourself out there. So in this article, I am showcasing every "Amazing Currency Converter" blog post that my classmates made!**

### GitHub: Scrimba Class of 2020

**(I invited anyone interested in working on a collaborative GitHub project I created.)**

![Scrimba Class of 2020](img/01-17-21/ClassOf2020.png)

As I elaborated in course suggestions on Scrimba's Discord channel, I took the initiative and created a GitHub project for student collaborative practice. As it is an open-source group project, everyone is entitled to add this project to their portfolio!
