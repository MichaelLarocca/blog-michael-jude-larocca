### What is UI/UX Design

UI Design stands for "**user interface**." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design) describes, "User interface design or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience."

UX Design stands for "**user experience**." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) describes, "The user experience is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, system or service. It includes a person's perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency."

### My introduction to CSS

After learning **HTML** (*HyperText Markup Language*), the next step in learning front-end web development is to learn **CSS** (*Cascading Style Sheets*). Apart from the syntax, when I researched what CSS was all about, I discovered that it has a lot to do with colors, fonts, style, structure, and the overall users' interactive experience.

After my newfound understanding, I immediately thought, "learning CSS does not sound like a job for a programmer. Learning CSS sounds like a job for a graphic designer."

##### Since I aspire to become a well-versed front-end web developer, I decided to "put aside" coding for a moment and learn about graphic design fundamentals.

*While researching graphic design, I found this helpful YouTube playlist [Graphic Design](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpQQipWcxwt9U7qgyYkvNH3Mp8XHXCMmQ).*

*I also purchased and completed this Udemy course, [The Complete Graphic Design Theory for Beginners Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphic-design-theory-for-beginners-course/).*

*Finally,  I discovered my favorite UI design source for coders, the DesignCourse YouTube channel created by [Gary Simon](https://www.youtube.com/user/DesignCourse)!*

### DesignCourse YouTube Chanel

I can not speak highly enough about Gary Simon's [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/user/DesignCourse) YouTube channel.

As an aspiring front-end web developer, the information that he provides is invaluable. Not only does he teach you all about design, but he also teaches you how to code!

To teach us, Gary created this free YouTube tutorial **"Learn UI Design 7 Fundamentals Tutorial - Full Course for Beginners."**

**The topics covered in the course are the UI Design Fundamentals:**

* White Space
* Color
* Contrast
* Scale

Gary references the "**UI Design Fundamentals**" frequently in his lessons.

Even though I am not a graphic designer, by just having a basic understanding of the UI Design Fundamentals, I noticed a drastic improvement in my work by applying them!
