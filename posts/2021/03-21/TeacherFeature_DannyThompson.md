**I was introduced to Danny Thompson through one of Scrimba's JavaScriptmas challenges. What got my attention immediately was his teaching style. While Danny explains programming concepts, he talks to you positively and uplifting, much like a motivational coach. I found his teaching style to be exceptional and professional.**

#### When I completed Danny's JavaScriptmas challenge, I searched for him online to learn more about him. I found his Twitter and LinkedIn accounts and decided to follow him.

**Deciding to follow Danny Thompson on social media was one of the best decisions I made during my self-taught coding journey! Every day I now receive messages that inspire, motivate, and reaffirm my belief in myself.**

### About Danny Thompson

Danny Thompson is a self-taught developer that started coding in his thirties. At that time, Danny was working at a gas station. Without a college degree, He found himself at a fork in the road.

He decided to transition into tech when he was inspired by a rapper who invested several million dollars into a tech company.

Danny learned the basics online from Free Code Camp and then started attending meetups. He accentuates the importance of "networking" with other coders.

In this YouTube Scrimba Livestream, Danny answered my question that apparently many people have:

**My question:** *â€‹I'm concerned about transitioning into tech, as I am going into my late 40's. Is age an issue if you do not have prior web developer experience, even if your skills qualify?*

**Danny's answer:** *You are not late, you are right on time! Whenever you decide to code, it is the right time.*

---

**Danny then lists:**

* He worked with a great 23-year-old developer
* He was 30 when he transitioned into tech
* His best friend transitioned at 46
* He worked with an incredible 62-year-old developer

---

*Danny states, "don't isolate your ideas to one specific area."*

---

**There are many ways to make money in tech:**

* Become a freelancer
* Make a product
* Make courses
* Offer mentor services
* Teach at a Bootcamp

Danny then elaborates on "giving yourself permission to take your time learning how to code." Also, Danny wants us to know that developers are in demand and that they are getting hired.

---

**However, Danny does warn us that it would be disingenuous for him to say that the tech industry doesn't have all of the "isms:"**

* Racism
* Ageism
* Sexism

Danny explains that the "isms" exist in every single industry, and it would be wrong of him the say that "it's going to be smooth sailing."

"This is your journey into tech. It is going to be hard. We need to keep this perspective in mind. We have to go in with an open heart, open mind, be ready to be disappointed, and be ready to be excited."

"There will be moments when we love the process, and there will be moments when we hate the process."

Danny explains to us that our joy shouldn't only come when we reach our goal, that we should celebrate all of the accomplishments along the journey.

***Danny quotes: "Coding is the culmination of the very consistent small wins."***
