## Want to expedite learning how to code? Then you got to learn from James, QUICK!

![James Q Quick](img/03-15-21/JamesQQuick.png)

#### James is a Fullstack Developer that lives by the motto "**Learn Build Teach!**" He creates valuable web dev content weekly.

I was introduced to James through the online coding school Scrimba. I am currently taking courses on Scrimba, and James is one of the teachers.

To make it in time for this article, I'm taking his "**Build a color tool in vanilla JavaScript**" Srimba course!

---

### Scrimba course:

### [Build a color tool in vanilla JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptcolortool)

In this course, James teaches us how to create a color tool.

**The topics covered in the course are:**

* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* DOM manipulation
* Hex and RGB colors
* Creating a custom toggle button

### How the color tool works

When the color tool project is complete, the user enters a Hex color. The Hex color entered is displayed as the background color of the "Input Color" box.

There is a slider that changes the inputted Hex value. The Hex color is lighted or darkened in the "Altered Color" box depending on the toggle switch's selection.

During the course, James encourages us to create a theme for the color tool. Naturally, I chose to make a Star Wars theme.

When the lighten toggle button is selected for my newly created theme, I added a rebel logo to it and added an Anakin Skywalker background image.

While taking this Scrimba course, I found James Q Quick to be an excellent teacher. He has an articulate teaching style, and he explains complex programming concepts in a manner that is easy to follow.

**In this YouTube video, James teaches us that all you need is a computer, access to the internet, and dedication to become a web developer.**

---

Even though there is a lot of free content available to learn from, I agree with James that there is a lack of structure when trying to learn on your own.

To give you a solid foundation of learning web development from beginning to end, James shares the course that he took with us, [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

*I highly suggest you watch this YouTube video that James created for valuable detailed information on the course.*
