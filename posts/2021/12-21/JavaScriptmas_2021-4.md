### Community Highlights

Well, it looks like I'm not the only one who found **Matt's** ([@mattemmmmm](https://twitter.com/mattemmmmm)) "Snow Man Customer," Michael and Leanne found it too!

The same project of Matt's, which I featured in my last article, was also featured in Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021 Live Finale!

When you are finished customizing Matt's snowman, you can send it to the beach and watch him melt!

Debbie ([@debbie_digital](https://twitter.com/debbie_digital)), featured in my first JavaScriptmas 2021 article, was also featured in Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021 Live Finale! 

In Debbie's Reindeer Speedometer project, the background image changes with a corresponding picture of the current location selected, nicely done!

Muhammad Tahir ([@tahir__k](https://twitter.com/tahir__k)), featured in my second JavaScriptmas 2021 article, was also featured in Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021 Live Finale! 

Muhammad Tahir's Reindeer Speedometer project also changes the background image with a corresponding picture of the selected current location. The project also includes an average speed as well as an overall average.

Up next, Aaron's Lonely Elf project was featured in Scrimba's JavaScriptmas 2021 Live Finale! 

In Aaron's project, the elves are duplicated each time the "Duplicate Elf" button is clicked; one elf becomes two, two elves become four, four elves become eight, and so forth.

However, once the elves exceed one hundred in number, the elf overlord starts to reduce the elves, one by one, until there are exactly one hundred elves. Finally, when the elves are reduced to one hundred, the elves animate in a jumping "wave,"  similar to the "wave" created by fans at a sporting event.

The next featured project is Simon's Christmas Dogs Carousel. This carousel consists of adorable dogs in festive settings, and this project includes a zoom-in and zoom-out feature! Well done!

Next up is Hugo's Festivities Loading project. Hugo achieved the effect that I initially wanted; Hugo successfully designed the actual loading bar and made it look like a candy cane!

I will definitely be looking into his code to see how he accomplished this effect!

Last but certainly not least is David's Desert Decider project. Not only does his project retrieve images of delicious desserts in a festive setting, but his project also stores the images in an array so that the user can click on a "Previous desert" button to view them! 

Michael, Leanne, and the Livestream audience, including myself, were very impressed! Well done, Hugo!
