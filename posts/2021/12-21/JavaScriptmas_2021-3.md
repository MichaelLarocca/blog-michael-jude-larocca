### Scrimba's Twitter Space 

What is a Twitter Space? Twitter Spaces are events held on Twitter where the host of the space conducts live conversations with the speakers assigned to a panel and with audience members invited up to the panel.

Scrimba's most recent Twitter Space was a conversation on the topic, "**Tricky non-technical interview questions and answers**."

Hosts: [Alex](https://twitter.com/bookercodes) and [Leanne](https://twitter.com/RybaLeanne)

**Speakers:** 

* [@TechRally](https://twitter.com/TechRally)
* [@willjohnsonio](https://twitter.com/willjohnsonio)
* [@TechSquidTV](https://twitter.com/TechSquidTV)
* [@sahanarajasekar](https://twitter.com/sahanarajasekar)
* [@xDeniTech](https://twitter.com/xDeniTech)

### Tell me about yourself.

The first question covered during Scrimba's Twitter Space was "**Tell me about yourself**."

**To handle this question, we are advised to keep our answer succinct.** 

Keep your answer on the topic of the position you are applying for, show enthusiasm for the technologies you are using, and lead your enthusiasm back to the company you are interviewing for.

***Notes:*** *Keep it succinct, show enthusiasm, lead your enthusiasm back to why you want to work there.*

---

### Why do you want to work here? 

**To best answer the question, "Why do you want to work here" is to have first thoroughly researched the company you are applying for.**

You can learn about the company you are applying for by researching their website. Go over their about page and create a relevant bullet point list of essential aspects of the company. 

***Notes:*** *Do your research on the company you are applying for.*

---

### Questions to ask at the end of the interview

We are encouraged to ask questions at the end of the interview. Not doing so may lead to the impression that we are not that interested in the position we are applying for.

**Questions to ask at the end of the interview:**

1. What will be my responsibility for the first 30 days?
2. Do you have tips for me? 
3. Your expectations of me for my first full year?

***Notes:*** *Ask questions (it's a 2-way street). Not asking questions may reflect that you are uninterested.*

---

### What can you bring to the table/company?

When asked, "**What can you bring to the table/company?**" describe what you are passionate about, and lead it into how your skills will help their company.

**describe what you are passionate about:**

* You are self-motivated
* You are a coding enthusiast
* You enjoy solving problems
* You're concerned about helping customers' needs
* You will hold your tech team to high standards

***Notes:*** *You are self-motivated, love to code, solve problems, help customers' needs, hold the tech team to high standards.*

---

### Tell me about a difficult work relationship.

**Tell me about a difficult work relationship with a co-worker and how you resolved it.**

To handle this delicate question, we are advised to keep our skills as a coder separate from ourselves and our soft skills, or we will take everything personally.

Also, share a story where you actually resolved the issue with your co-worker. [@TechRally](https://twitter.com/TechRally), during the Twitter Space, explained that he failed an interview because he shared an "unresolved" story of a difficult work relationship with a co-worker.

***Notes:***  *Share a "resolved" story of a difficult work relationship with a co-worker. Try to resolve the problem with the co-worker before you bring it up to a manager/management.* 

---

### Salary negotiation

When it comes to salary negotiation, we are advised to determine the salary range beforehand and make sure we are comfortable with the range.

In addition to the offered salary, keep in mind the benefits offered. Healthcare, vacation time, matched contributions to your 401(k) account all together construct your overall compensation.

Also, we are told that we will have leverage during salary negotiation if we currently have other job offers at the time of the interview. 

***Notes:*** *Know the salary range beforehand, keep in mind the overall compensation offered, and you can gain leverage by having multiple other job offers.* 

---

### Why are you leaving your current job?

When we are asked why we are leaving our current job, we are encouraged to focus less on why we are leaving and more on why we want to work there.

We are to present everything positively, and we are instructed not to bash people at our current or previous jobs.

**Reasons for leaving our current job:**

* Want to move up professionally
* You learned all you can at your current job
* Looking to expand your skills

***Notes:*** *Focus less on why you are leaving and more on why you want to work there. Present everything positively, and do not "bad talk" anyone you previously worked with.* 

---

### Summary of the Twitter Space

The best way to handle "**tricky non-technical interview questions**" is to be well prepared. Research the company you are applying for, keep your answers succinct and on topic, and make sure you are also prepared to ask your own questions.

Make sure you always shine a positive light on yourself and do not bad-talk past or current colleagues. 

Show enthusiasm about working for them, demonstrate how your skill will benefit their company, and tactfully explain why you are leaving your current job.
