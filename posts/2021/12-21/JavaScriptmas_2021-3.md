### Tell me about yourself.

The first question covered during Scrimba's Twitter Space was "**Tell me about yourself**."

**To handle this question, we are advised to keep our answer succinct.** 

Keep your answer on the topic of the position you are applying for, show enthusiasm for the technologies you are using, and lead your enthusiasm back to the company you are interviewing for.

***Notes:*** *Keep it succinct, show enthusiasm, lead your enthusiasm back to why you want to work there.*

### Why do you want to work here? 

**To best answer the question, "Why do you want to work here" is to have first thoroughly researched the company you are applying for.**

You can learn about the company you are applying for by researching their website. Go over their about page and create a relevant bullet point list of essential aspects of the company. 

***Notes:*** *Do your research on the company you are applying for.*

### Questions to ask at the end of the interview

We are encouraged to ask questions at the end of the interview. Not doing so may lead to the impression that we are not that interested in the position we are applying for.

**Questions to ask at the end of the interview:**

1. What will be my responsibility for the first 30 days?
2. Do you have tips for me? 
3. Your expectations of me for my first full year?

***Notes:*** *Ask questions (it's a 2-way street). Not asking questions may reflect that you are uninterested.*

* You are self-motivated
* You are a coding enthusiast
* You enjoy solving problems
* You're concerned about helping customers' needs
* You will hold your tech team to high standards
