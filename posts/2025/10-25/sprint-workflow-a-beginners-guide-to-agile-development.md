### What Is a Sprint?

A sprint is a short, focused period of work during which a development team tackles specific tasks or goals (for my team, it‚Äôs two-week periods). In modern software projects, sprints help teams stay organized, track progress, and deliver updates efficiently.

### What is Agile Development

Agile development is a way of building software that focuses on flexibility, teamwork, and continuous improvement. Instead of planning everything up front, teams work in short sprints to deliver small, usable project pieces. After each sprint, the team reviews what went well and what can be improved, making it easier to adapt to changes and deliver better results. Agile helps teams stay organized, respond quickly to feedback, and progress projects.

### What is a Sprint Board & Ticket?

**I like explaining a ticket by analogy‚Äîthink of a ticket as an index card pinned to a corkboard (Sprint Board). In the following example, the corkboard has five column headers labeled as follows:**

* To Do
    
* In Progress
    
* In Review
    
* Testing
    
* Done
    

*The index card lists tasks and moves through each column of the corkboard as the tasks are completed.*

| To Do | In Progress | In Review | Testing | Done |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (TICKET) |  |  |  |  |

#### To Do

**Let‚Äôs write two tasks on the imagined index card:**

1. Update the README file to include the new login feature
    
2. Add a URL link to the deployed project.
    

*The provided index card (sprint ticket) will have an auto-generated number; let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 12.*

Now, I will assign YOU to complete ticket number 12. After reviewing the assigned tasks, you will let the team know how long it will take you to complete. This is done using a point system.

**A point represents a time variable that can differ among teams. Our team‚Äôs point system is as follows:**

* point-0: within 2 hours
    
* point-1: within 1/2 day
    
* point-3: within 1 day
    
* point-5: within 3 days
    
* point-8: within 1 week
    

Since this is your first ticket, a full day will be acceptable for the task as you will need time to write documentation for the new login procedure and add a URL to the project. Therefore, you should mark your ticket with 3 points (which represents a day).

#### In Progress

Once you start working on your assigned ticket, you move it to the ‚Äú**In Progress**‚Äú column. When you complete it, you move it to the ‚ÄúIn Review‚Äú column and notify your team.

#### In Review

The review phase of your ticket involves an assigned team member reviewing it to ensure that all of the assigned tasks were completed. In this demonstration, you needed to write documentation in the README file detailing the new login procedure and adding a URL to the project.

---

‚ö† **Important:** *You are NOT to go beyond the tasks on your ticket! For example, you would not add additional information to the README file regarding other aspects of the project. Although your intentions are good, since it goes beyond the scope of the ticket, it will be refused because it will cause confusion and disorganization. Further README file updates should be added to new future tickets.*

---

#### Testing

Once the ticket passes the review stage, it is moved to testing to ensure the code functions properly; in this simple example, the project link must be clickable and direct to the correct URL. If your ticket passes the testing phase, it is closed and moved to the ‚ÄúDone‚Äú column.

#### Done

The done column is filled with completed tickets, showcasing all of the project's updates. Great work on completing your ticket and properly maintaining a professional team workflow using a sprint ticket and a sprint board!

### Additional Sprint Tasks

Now that we have covered a simple version of a sprint ticket and a sprint board, I can offer you more details of my team‚Äôs process.

#### Additional Sprint Board Columns:

* **No Status:** Tasks or tickets that haven‚Äôt been assigned a workflow stage yet.
    
* **Back Log:** A list of tasks or ideas waiting to be worked on in future sprints.
    
* **Epics:** Large, high-level tasks or projects broken down into smaller tickets.
    
* **Blocked:** Tasks that cannot move forward due to an issue or dependency.
    

**Leftover Tickets**

What do we do with leftover tickets that weren‚Äôt completed during the sprint? They are usually moved back to the backlog or carried over to the next sprint for further work. Reviewing leftover tickets helps the team understand what caused delays and improves future planning, ensuring that important tasks aren‚Äôt forgotten.

#### Team Meetings

* **Stand-ups:** Short daily meetings where team members share progress, plans, and blockers.
    
* **Weekly Meetings:** Longer meetings held once a week to review progress, plan upcoming work, and discuss any issues.
    
* **One-on-one:** Private meetings between two team members (often a manager and developer) to discuss individual goals, feedback, or concerns.
    

#### Future Sprint Planning

Sprint planning is the meeting where the team decides which tasks or tickets will be tackled in the upcoming sprint. During this session, team members review the backlog, estimate the effort required for each item, and agree on the sprint goals. The result is a clear plan that outlines what will be accomplished and who is responsible for each task, helping everyone stay focused and aligned throughout the sprint.

### Conclusion

A sprint is a short, focused period of work during which a development team completes specific tasks or goals. Sprints are an essential part of Agile development, a method of software creation that stresses flexibility, teamwork, and continuous improvement.

Sprint tasks are tracked using tickets that include detailed instructions. As work progresses, these tickets are moved across titled columns on a Sprint Board‚ÄîTo Do, In Progress, In Review, Testing, and Done, among others. Each ticket is assigned an estimated completion time by the assignee using a point system. Points represent time intervals that can differ between teams, such as point-1 for half a day, point-3 for one day, and point-5 for three days. Leftover tickets that weren‚Äôt completed during a sprint are typically moved back to the backlog or carried over to the next sprint for further work.

Regular team meetings keep everyone aligned and productive. Daily stand-ups help share progress and blockers, weekly meetings review progress and plan ahead, and one-on-ones focus on individual goals and feedback. Future sprint planning prepares the team for the next cycle by reviewing the backlog, estimating tasks, and setting clear goals. This ongoing process helps teams stay organized, adaptable, and successful.
