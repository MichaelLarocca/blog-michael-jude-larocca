### Using setInterval in JavaScript Games

The JavaScript [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setInterval) method is a useful tool for executing actions repeatedly at specific time intervals. It‚Äôs commonly used in games to animate movement, update game logic, and create a sense of real-time action.

For example, in my Pac-Man project, I use setInterval to move Pac-Man and each ghost independently. By calling the movement functions at regular intervals, the game simulates continuous motion and enables dynamic interactions between characters.

```javascript
// Move Pac-Man every pacManSpeed milliseconds
let speedStartPacMan = setInterval(control, pacManSpeed);

// Move each ghost at its own speed
ghosts.forEach(ghost => moveGhost(ghost));
```

This approach makes it easy to control how fast each character moves and to update the game state in real time. However, using separate intervals for different entities can also introduce timing challenges, especially when detecting collisions.

### Collisions Detection Problems

My JavaScript game project originally used DOM classes to detect collisions between Pac-Man and the ghosts; when a single div contained a Pac-Man class and a ghost class, there was a collision. However, this programming approach proved to be unreliable.

I improved the game‚Äôs collision detection by alternatively using state management: comparing Pac-Man's current index to the ghost‚Äôs current index. But there were still missed collisions.

**The underlying missed collision issue was due to separate timing intervals for Pac-Man and the individual ghosts. Although the state management approach worked, Pac-Man and the ghosts would enter and exit the same div, resulting in missed collisions due to timing. The solution was adding an extra collision check: tracking previous positions and checking for crossed-path collisions.**

**Pac-Man and the ghosts run with separate intervals:**

```javascript
function setPacManSpeed() {
  let speedStartPacMan = setInterval(control, pacManSpeed);  
}

export function moveGhost(ghost) {
// ...existing code...
    ghost.timerId = setInterval(function() {
// ...existing code...
}, ghost.speed);
```

### Crossed Paths Collision Detection

What I learned: In grid-based games like Pac-Man, entities often move on separate timers, which can lead to subtle collision detection problems. One such issue is the **crossed-paths collision**.

**What is a crossed-paths collision?**  
*This occurs when two entities move into each other‚Äôs previous positions in the same tick, effectively ‚Äúpassing through‚Äù each other. Without tracking previous positions, this collision can be missed.*

To solve this, I enhanced my collision detection by introducing new variables to track Pac-Man's and each ghost's previous positions. By comparing both current and previous index values, I can now reliably detect crossed-path collisions.

**Pac-Man and the ghosts'¬†previous index are now also compared for crossed-path collision detection:**

---

```javascript
export function checkForGhostCatchesPacMan() {
  ghosts.forEach(ghost => {
    // Direct collision
    if (ghost.currentIndex === pacmanCurrentIndex) {
      // Handle collision...
    }
    // Crossed-paths collision
    else if (
      ghost.currentIndex === pacmanPreviousIndex &&
      ghost.previousIndex === pacmanCurrentIndex
    ) {
      // Handle collision...
    }
  });
}
```

### Game Engines

Game engines, such as Phaser, MelonJS, or Babylon.js, are another option for JavaScript game development. These engines provide built-in collision detection systems and many other features that make game development faster and more reliable. Soon, I plan to learn [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) to explore how professional engines handle movement, collisions, and game logic!

### Final Thoughts

For anyone developing games in JavaScript, using state management‚Äîparticularly by comparing both current and previous positions of your game entities‚Äîis a reliable method for robust collision detection. Tracking these variables allows you to accurately identify not only direct collisions but also cases where entities cross paths within the same tick, which is a common challenge when using separate intervals for movement. This approach helps ensure your collision logic functions smoothly, even in fast-paced or grid-based games!

### Conclusion

Solid collision detection is crucial when developing JavaScript games, and admittedly, quite tricky to accomplish. My first attempt was using the DOM (CSS classes) to detect collisions, but it proved to be too unreliable. Next, I refactored my code to detect collisions using state management (comparing indexes), which worked better but still missed collisions. It turns out the issue I was having was due to the individual game character timings (Pac-Man and the ghosts), a common problem known as crossed-path collisions.

Crossed-path collisions occur when entities move into each other's previous positions during the same update, often missed when using separate movement intervals. I was able to finally detect crossed-path collisions by adding an additional check: tracking Pac-Man's and each ghost's previous positions.

For JavaScript game developers, using state management to compare both current and previous positions of game entities is a dependable way to detect collisions. This approach reliably identifies direct hits and cases where entities cross paths in the same tick, ensuring accurate collision detection even in fast-paced or grid-based games!
