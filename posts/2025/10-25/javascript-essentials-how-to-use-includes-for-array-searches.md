#### In this article, we explore JavaScript's .includes() method for searching arrays, including practical implementations in game development. You'll learn coding techniques to enhance your own projects!

### .includes()

What is .includes()? [Array.prototype.includes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes) is a built-in JavaScript array method that checks if an array contains a specific element. It returns true if the element is found, and false otherwise.

**Syntax:**

* **element:** The value to search for.
    
* f**romIndex (optional)**: The position in the array to start searching.
    

```javascript
array.includes(element, fromIndex)
```

### What You Can Do With .includes()

The `.includes()` method is excellent for checking if an array contains a specific value‚Äîit even works with emojis! For a simple demonstration, here‚Äôs how I use `.includes()` in my Pac-Man project to check for particular fruits. As you can see, the apple returns `true` because it is included in the array (in fact, there are two apples), and the watermelon returns `false` because it is not in the `fruitBonus` array.

```javascript
// Example from my Pac-Man project
const fruitBonus = ['üçí','üçì','üçä','üçä','üçé','üçé','üçà','üçà','üöÄ','üîî','üîë'];

console.log(fruitBonus.includes('üçé')); // true
console.log(fruitBonus.includes('üçâ')); // false
```

---

‚ö† **Important:** There are limitations to using `.includes()`. While it works perfectly for primitive values like numbers, strings, and emojis, it does not perform deep checks for nested arrays or objects. Using `.includes()` with arrays or objects will only return `true` if the reference matches exactly‚Äînot if the contents are the same. You‚Äôll need a different approach for deep comparisons, such as using `.some()` with a custom comparison function.

### Putting .includes() to Good Use

I successfully used `.includes()` to improve ghost movement in my JavaScript Pac-Man game! I created an array containing all the intersection indices on the game board, and used `.includes()` to detect when a ghost enters an intersection. This allows the ghost to change direction at the correct spots, just like in the original arcade game.

**The intersectionIndices array:**

```javascript
export const intersectionIndices = [
    34, 49,
    141, 146, 149, 152, 155, 158, 161, 166,
    230, 245,
    320, 323,
    377, 378,
    398, 401, 410, 413,
    485, 494,
    566, 569, 578, 581,
    650, 653, 656, 659, 662, 665,
    731, 752,
    824, 827
];
```

---

### Adding the Intersections

During board construction, squares whose index is listed in `intersectionIndices` are assigned the 'intersection' class. This visually and logically marks those squares as intersections for game logic.

```javascript

export function buildTheBoard() {
  for(let i = 0; i < 868; i++) {
    let div = document.createElement("div");
    gameGrid.appendChild(div);  
    squares.push(div);
    squares[i].classList.add('game-board-square');  

    if (intersectionIndices.includes(i)) {
      squares[i].classList.add('intersection');
    }    
  }    
}
```

Below, you can see every intersection included in the `intersectionIndices` array, courtesy of the ‚Äòintersection‚Äò class:

### Helper Intersection function

Here is a simple helper function, used for game logic, that takes an index as a parameter, uses `.includes()`, and returns `true` if the specified index is an intersection:

```javascript
// Helper function to check if a given index is an intersection
function isIntersection(index) {
  return intersectionIndices.includes(index);
}
```

### Improved Ghost Movement using .includes()

Now that I have a function that detects intersections, I can use it to see if a ghost‚Äôs current index includes one. Once a ghost enters an intersection, I trigger a direction change‚Äîmaking the ghosts smarter!

**How It Works: Each ghost moves automatically on a timer. At every step, the code checks if the ghost is on an intersection square (using isIntersection and .includes()). If the ghost is at an intersection:**

* The code figures out which directions are possible (not blocked by walls or other ghosts).
    
* It avoids making the ghost immediately turn around (no U-turns unless stuck).
    
* It randomly picks one of the valid directions and updates the ghost‚Äôs movement.
    

```javascript
// Ghost movement logic uses isIntersection to trigger intersection behavior
export function moveGhost(ghost) {
  const directions = [-1, 1, 28, -28];
  let direction = ghost.direction || directions[Math.floor(Math.random() * directions.length)];
  
  ghost.timerId = setInterval(function() {
    // ...existing movement logic...

    // At intersections, choose a new direction
    if (isIntersection(ghost.currentIndex)) {
      const reverseDir = ghost.previousIndex - ghost.currentIndex;
      let validDirections = directions.filter(dir => {
        if (dir === reverseDir) return false;
        const nextIndex = ghost.currentIndex + dir;
        return (
          !squares[nextIndex].classList.contains('ghost') &&
          !squares[nextIndex].classList.contains('lairText') &&
          !squares[nextIndex].classList.contains('wall') &&
          !(dir === 28 && squares[nextIndex].classList.contains('lairWall')) &&
          (nextIndex !== 375) &&
          (nextIndex !== 380)
        );
      });

      if (validDirections.length === 0) {
        validDirections = [reverseDir];
      }
      
      if (validDirections.length > 0) {
        direction = validDirections[Math.floor(Math.random() * validDirections.length)];
        ghost.direction = direction;
      }
    }

    // ...rest of movement logic...
  }, ghost.speed);
}
```

***By checking for intersections with JavaScript‚Äôs .includes(), I ensure ghosts only change direction at the right spots. This brings my project closer to the original arcade experience and creates more authentic, challenging gameplay!***

### Conclusion

The JavaScript `.includes()` method checks whether an array contains a specific element, returning `true` if it does and `false` if it doesn't. It‚Äôs great for verifying if an array has a particular value, but it does have limitations. While it works well for simple values like numbers, strings, or (in my project‚Äôs case) emojis, it doesn‚Äôt check inside nested arrays or objects.

By utilizing `.includes()` in the function that controls the ghosts in my Pac-Man game, I can determine when a ghost‚Äôs current index enters an intersection and trigger a direction change. This makes the ghosts smarter and brings my project closer to the original arcade experience!

Just as I used `.includes()` with an array of intersections to improve game logic, you can also find creative ways to combine this method with your own data structures. Explore how `.includes()` can simplify checks and enhance features in your projects‚Äîexperiment and see what smart solutions you can build!
