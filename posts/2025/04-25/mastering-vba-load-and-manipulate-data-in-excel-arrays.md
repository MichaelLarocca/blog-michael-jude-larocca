### Why Load Data into an Array

When creating Excel sheets to work with data from another source, such as exported data from a proprietary work system, loading that data into an array provides you with complete control over its manipulation. Combining built-in functions in an Excel worksheet template with exported data from an array allows you to accomplish incredible feats, such as building custom-made applications to streamline workflow.

*One such application I created in this manner is a truck driver route sheet. In a custom-made template, I added sum functions to calculate the total number of stops, the total amount of each customer‚Äôs invoices, and the grand total invoice amount on the truck. Using exported data containing all of the day‚Äôs customer orders loaded in an array, like magic, the user clicks an update button, and then the entire worksheet is filled out for them. This saved a lot of time as the data on these sheets were previously entered manually.*

**By learning how to load and manage data in an array, you can create custom-made applications to streamline the workflow of companies you work for, making you an invaluable asset.**

### Loading Data into an Array

On an individual basis, you will need to learn how to export the required data into an Excel file from the proprietary work systems you use. If you're fortunate, someone might demonstrate it for you. In my case, I had to mostly figure it out on my own.

**For simplicity, let's use make-believe exported customer addresses from the Star Wars universe to load into an array:**

| CUSTOMER | CUSTOMER Name | ADDRESS | ZIP CODE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TAT01 | Tatooine Traders | 123 Sand Dune Lane, Tatooine | 12345 |
| HOTH02 | Hoth Ice Sculptures | 456 Ice Cave Blvd, Hoth | 67890 |
| END03 | Endor Ewok Emporium | 789 Forest Path, Endor | 11223 |
| COR04 | Coruscant Couture | 101 Sky City Ave, Coruscant | 33445 |
| NAB05 | Naboo Nifty Novelties | 202 Lake Retreat Rd, Naboo | 55678 |
| TAT06 | Tatooine Textiles | 321 Desert Way, Tatooine | 12345 |
| HOTH07 | Hoth Hot Drinks | 654 Snowflake St, Hoth | 67890 |
| END08 | Endor Exotic Exports | 987 Treehouse Ln, Endor | 11223 |
| COR09 | Coruscant Crafts | 202 Galactic Blvd, Coruscant | 33445 |
| NAB10 | Naboo Nature Goods | 303 Waterfall Way, Naboo | 55678 |

### Steps to Load Data into an Array

This section outlines how to load data from an Excel worksheet into an array using VBA, including setting up your environment, declaring variables, and executing the code.

*Setting Up the Environment: Enable the Developer tab in Excel to access the VBA editor and macro tools. For detailed steps, refer to my article "*[*What is Microsoft VBA and Why You Should Learn It*](https://selftaughttxg.com/2025/02-25/what-is-microsoft-vba-and-why-you-should-learn-it/)*."*

**Declaring Variables**:

* `wsData As Worksheet`: References the worksheet containing the data.
    
* `dataRange As Range`: Defines the range of cells to be loaded into the array.
    
* `lastRow As Long` and `lastCol As Long`: Determine the data boundaries.
    
* `dataArray As Variant`: Stores the data for manipulation.
    
* `i As Long`: Counter for iterating through the array.
    
* `message As String`: Holds text for display in a message box.
    

### Loading Data from Excel into an Array Using VBA

Below is a VBA subroutine demonstrating how to load data from an Excel worksheet into an array for efficient manipulation.

```basic
Sub LoadDataIntoArray()
    Dim wsData As Worksheet
    Dim dataRange As Range
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim lastCol As Long
    Dim dataArray As Variant
    Dim i As Long
    Dim message As String

    ' Set the data worksheet
    Set wsData = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change "Sheet1" to your data sheet name

    ' Find the last row and column with data
    lastRow = wsData.Cells(wsData.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
    lastCol = wsData.Cells(1, wsData.Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column

    ' Define the range to load into the array (excluding headers)
    If lastRow > 1 Then ' Ensure there are rows to process
        Set dataRange = wsData.Range(wsData.Cells(2, 1), wsData.Cells(lastRow, lastCol))
    Else
        MsgBox "Not enough data to process."
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Load the data into the array
    dataArray = dataRange.Value

    ' Build the message string
    message = "Total Records: " & UBound(dataArray, 1) & vbCrLf & vbCrLf
    For i = 1 To UBound(dataArray, 1)
        message = message & "Record " & i & ": "
        For j = 1 To UBound(dataArray, 2)
            message = message & dataArray(i, j) & " "
        Next j
        message = message & vbCrLf
    Next i

    ' Display the message box with all data
    MsgBox message
End Sub
```

### Explanation of the Steps

* **Worksheet Setup**: `wsData` references the worksheet. Ensure the sheet name matches your data sheet.
    
* **Identify Data Boundaries**: `lastRow` and `lastCol` determine the data's extent.
    
* **Define Data Range**: `dataRange` includes all data cells, excluding headers.
    
* **Load Data into Array**: Data is loaded into `dataArray` for processing.
    
* **Error Handling**: Ensures sufficient data is available; otherwise, it alerts the user.
    

*After running the program, you will see a dialog box displaying the data loaded into the array. The message box will first indicate the total number of records processed. It will then list each record, showing the data from each row in the specified range of the Excel worksheet. If there is insufficient data to process, you will receive an alert indicating that more data is needed. This visual feedback verifies that the data has been correctly loaded and is ready for further manipulation or analysis.*
