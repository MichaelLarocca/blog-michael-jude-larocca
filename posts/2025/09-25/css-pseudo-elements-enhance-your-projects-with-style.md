### CSS Before & After Pseudo-Elements

CSS pseudo-elements allow you to insert content before or after an element's actual content without adding extra HTML elements. The [::before](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) and [::after](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) pseudo-elements are popular and can help you style and modify content easily.

**Some of the other commonly used pseudo-elements include:**

1. `::first-line`: Applies styles to the first line of a block-level element.
    
2. `::first-letter`: Styles the first letter of a block-level element.
    
3. `::selection`: Styles the portion of an element that is selected by the user.
    
4. `::placeholder`: Styles the placeholder text in an input or textarea element.
    
5. `::marker`: Styles the marker box of a list item, such as bullets or numbers.
    

‚ö† **Important:** *Pseudo-elements can't be targeted in JavaScript as they aren't part of the DOM. They serve decorative purposes, but you can indirectly manipulate their styles by altering their parent elements' styles or modifying CSS rules dynamically.*

---

### Why Is This a Valuable Coding Concept?

Understanding and utilizing CSS pseudo-elements is valuable because they enhance styling capabilities by allowing you to add decorative content and style specific parts of an element without altering the HTML structure. This leads to improved code maintainability, as it keeps HTML clean and semantic, reducing the need for additional markup.

### Ghost‚Äôs Eye Direction

**This article explains how I used CSS pseudo-elements to add eyes to the ghosts in my JavaScript Pac-Man game and simulate their eye movements!**

For my JavaScript Pac-Man game, I created each ghost's eye using the before and after CSS pseudo-elements: the before pseudo-element for the left eye and the after pseudo-element for the right eye. Each eye is simply a boxed div with a 50% border radius, a black background, and a thick white border.

Taking creative liberty, I reposition the eyes to create the effect, differentiating it from the original arcade, where the pupils move. In my game, the left and right eyes remain grouped, and I slightly shift them in the direction they are moving. While in action, I believe it is pretty convincing!

üîó [Link to the CodePen project](https://codepen.io/Michael_Larocca/pen/YzNqBWj?editors=1100)

![Pac-Ghosts](img/09-29-25/Pac-Ghosts.png)

**First, I created a main ghost class. Using a black background, I rounded out the ghost‚Äôs head with the top left and right border radius, and I used a clip-path to create the jagged bottom of the ghost.**

```css
.ghost {
  border: 1px solid white;
  background-color: black;
  position: relative;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  margin:10px;
  border-top-left-radius: 50%;
  border-top-right-radius: 50%;
  clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 100% 0, 100% 100%, 81% 91%, 66% 100%, 49% 91%, 31% 100%, 15% 91%, 0 100%, 0 0);
}
```

Next, I create the ghost‚Äôs left eye using the `::before` CSS pseudo-element. I create a box and use a thick white border with a black background, rounding it out with a 50% border radius to complete the effect. The eye is positioned absolutely, sitting 100 pixels from the bottom and slightly shifted to the right with a margin, giving it the appearance of a floating eye on the ghost.

```css
.ghost::before {
  border: 12px solid white;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: black;
  content: "";
  width: 30px;
  height: 30px;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 100px;
  margin: 0 0 0 50px;
}
```

For the ghost's right eye, the `::after` CSS pseudo-element is used. It mirrors the left eye by creating another circular shape with a thick white border and a black background, using a 50% border radius for the round look. This eye is also positioned absolutely, 100 pixels from the bottom, but it's shifted further to the right with a margin, making it appear as the ghost's second floating eye.

```css
.ghost::after {
  border: 12px solid white;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background-color: black;
  content: "";
  width: 30px;
  height: 30px;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 100px;
  margin: 0 0 0 100px;
}
```

### Ghosts‚Äô Colors

I created a separate class for each ghost color so that I can easily use them in conjunction with the main ghost class.

```css
/* Ghost colors */
.ghost-red {
  background-color: rgb(255,12,14);
}
.ghost-pink {
  background-color: rgb(255,165,166);
}
.ghost-blue {
  background-color: rgb(147,255,255);
}
.ghost-orange {
  background-color: rgb(253,123,13);
}
```

---

### Scared Ghost Color

For a scared ghost, I changed the color of the ghost to blue and the eyes to white.

```css
/* Scared */
.scared {
 background-color: blue;
}

.scared::before,
.scared::after {
  background-color: white;
}
```

---

### Combining Ghost Classes

Now that there are classes for a main ghost, a ghost color, and a scared ghost, I can combine them to create a single ghost with the ability to change its eye direction!

```xml
<div class="flex">
  <div class="ghost ghost-red ghost-look-left"></div>
  <div class="ghost ghost-blue ghost-look-up"></div>
  <div class="ghost ghost-pink ghost-look-down"></div>
  <div class="ghost ghost-orange ghost-look-right"></div>
  <div class="ghost scared"></div>
  <div class="ghost"></div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Ghost Eye Direction

In my [JavaScript Pac-Man game](https://github.com/MichaelLarocca/pac-man-javascript-laroccade), I created a Ghost class that includes an eyes property and other properties essential for the ghost's functionality.

Within the function that moves the ghosts, there is code to determine a valid direction‚Äîleft, right, down, or up‚Äîand assign it. Once a direction is assigned, I update the CSS ghost's eye direction class by removing the current class and applying the new one.

```javascript
      // Eye direction
      if (direction === -1) {
        squares[ghost.currentIndex].classList.remove(ghost.eyes);
        ghost.eyes = `ghost-look-left-${eyeSize}`;
      } else if (direction === 1) {
        squares[ghost.currentIndex].classList.remove(ghost.eyes);
        ghost.eyes = `ghost-look-right-${eyeSize}`;
      } else if (direction === 28) {
        squares[ghost.currentIndex].classList.remove(ghost.eyes);
        ghost.eyes = `ghost-look-down-${eyeSize}`;
      } else if (direction === -28) {
        squares[ghost.currentIndex].classList.remove(ghost.eyes);
        ghost.eyes = `ghost-look-up-${eyeSize}`;
      }
```

*To make trial-and-error creation easier, I initially styled all the ghosts' eye directions on* [*CodePen*](https://codepen.io/Michael_Larocca/pen/YzNqBWj)*, using a ghost size of 200px for both width and height. In my game, the size of the ghost is either 20px or 10px in width and height, depending on full-screen or mobile view. With GitHub's CoPilot, I was able to easily resize the CSS values by letting the AI handle the calculations.*

### Conclusion

CSS pseudo-elements are great for styling projects without the need for additional HTML. You can easily style a first letter or line with pseudo-elements, markers like bullets, placeholder text, entire sections, and more. I used the before and after pseudo-elements for enhanced styling in my project.

Additional benefits include improved code maintainability by keeping HTML clean and semantic, performance optimization as the browser efficiently renders them, the ability to create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes, and the potential for dynamic visual effects through CSS transitions and animations.

In my Pac-Man game, I stylistically designed pseudo-element classes to represent the eyes of the ghosts looking in the left, right, up, and down directions. Using JavaScript, I change the direction of the ghosts' eyes based on their movement, producing a realistic effect that makes it seem like their eyes are looking in the direction they are moving.

Can you think of other unique styling ideas for your projects that utilize pseudo-elements? Experiment with them to unleash your creativity and transform your designs into something remarkable!
