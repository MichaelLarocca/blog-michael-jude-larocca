### Why Upgrading to Windows 11 Matters

As of October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer support Windows 10. If your computer uses the Windows 10 operating system, it will no longer be supported. This means that security updates, feature updates, technical support, and more will cease, leaving your PC vulnerable.

### The Easiest Way to Upgrade to Windows 11

Using Windows Update on your computer is the easiest way to upgrade to Windows 11.

**To Access Windows Update, Click:**

* Start
    
* Settings
    
* Update & Security
    

In Update & Security, run **Windows Update**. Once your computer receives all the required updates, you should see a “Download and install“ button to upgrade to Windows 11, if it’s not already displayed.

*Be sure to read and follow all of Microsoft’s prompts and documentation to ensure a smooth upgrade from Windows 10 to 11.*

### If You Don’t See an Upgrade Option

After running **Windows Update**, if you still do not see an option to upgrade to Windows 11, you can use Microsoft's official [PC Health Check App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11#pchealthcheck).

*Next to the “Download PC Health Check app“ button is a helpful link to Windows 11 system requirements.*

### If Your Computer Fails The Compatibility Test

Unfortunately, if your computer fails the compatibility test, you will not be able to upgrade it to Windows 11. If you want to ensure that your computer continually receives security updates, feature updates, technical support, and more, you will need to consider buying a new one with Windows 11 installed, or if you’re adventurous, you can alternatively build a PC and purchase a Windows 11 license.

*My main home laptop doesn't meet the requirements because of the processor. Luckily, I already own another laptop that came with Windows 11 preinstalled, which will now be my primary device as I retire my older one with Windows 10, since it will no longer be supported.*
