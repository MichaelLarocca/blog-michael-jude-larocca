### What is JavaScriptmas?

JavaScriptmas is a festive coding event hosted by Scrimba from December 1st to 24th. Each day, you will get a new JavaScript challenge to help improve your coding skills, and you can win prizes! You can submit each valid challenge solution twice for two chances of winning! Since it's a raffle, it's fair for developers of any coding level, as it doesn't depend on skill.

To submit your challenge solution, click "Submit Solution" to save your work, which will automatically enter you into the Grand Prize draw. For an additional chance to win, click the "Share" button to spread the JavaScriptmas cheer on X and/or LinkedIn‚Äîthey will select a second lucky winner from the social posts! The more challenges you solve, the better your chances of winning the grand prize, so keep submitting!

**On December 24th, they will be choosing two lucky Grand Prize winners who will each receive:**

* A 13‚Äù **MacBook** Air M3
    
* Merch from **MDN** and **Scrimba**
    
* Lifetime Scrimba Pro access
    

*Join the fun and improve your JavaScript skills this holiday season!*

#### **Community highlights**

In the spirit of the festive holiday season, I enjoy showcasing others' work in the community highlights section of my JavaScriptmas articles! I'll be searching X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and the Scrimba Discord channel for "outstanding" submissions by fellow participants to feature. üéâ

#### **My solutions**

As I do every year, I will participate in JavaScriptmas and share my solutions on social media. I will provide links to the Scrims in these coverage articles as I complete the challenges. üíª

### **Community highlights ‚¨á**

#### Alina [(@disc0night)](https://x.com/disc0night)

![Alina-Post](img/12-30-25/Alina-Post.jpg)

Alina completed all 24 JavaScriptmas challenges two years in a row, which is not an easy feat! As participants know, these challenges involve not only JavaScript but also various front-end web development concepts. From UI/UX Design, layouts, working with AI, and more, participants are often forced to stretch their current knowledge to solve them correctly.

Completing 24 JavaScriptmas challenges two years in a row requires hard work, dedication, stamina, and a positive, never-give-up, never-surrender attitude! Alina‚Äôs ability to consistently meet these challenges showcases her commitment to learning and growing as a developer. Keep up the fantastic work, Alina!

#### Emran Khan [(@emrankhan\_dev)](https://x.com/emrankhan_dev)

![Khan-Tweet](img/12-30-25/Khan-Tweet.jpg)

Not only did Emran solve the JavaScriptmas accessibility challenge, but he also took and completed the entire ‚ÄúLearn Accessible Web Design‚Äú Scrimba course and earned a certificate!

Fredrik Ridderfalk, a molecular biologist, science teacher, and front-end engineer, teaches the ‚Äú[Learn Accessible Web Design](https://scrimba.com/learn-accessible-web-design-c031)‚Äú Scrimba FREE course. This course focuses on equipping learners with the skills to create accessible websites and emphasizes the importance of inclusivity in web development through practical, hands-on challenges.

Emran is helping himself to grow his online presence by participating in and sharing his JavaScriptmas coding solutions. He is also solidifying himself as a web designer capable of programming with an accessibility-first approach. This visibility and skill help attract hiring managers and pave the way for a successful career. We can all learn from Emran‚Äôs dedication!

During the JavaScriptmas event, esteemed Scrimba teacher Thomas Chant invited me to their weekly Discord Town Hall event to share my expertise with the students. I was privileged with the opportunity to invite Thomas to the HTML All The Things Podcast so that he could, in return, share his expertise with the podcast audience.

In his Podcast special, Tom covered insights into effective learning strategies, the importance of community engagement in tech, and how leveraging AI can enhance productivity and innovation in web development so that YOU can advance your career!

*To learn more, I went a step further by writing a podcast coverage article that includes practical advice for anyone navigating tech careers:* [*Overcoming Job Market Challenges: Insights from a Successful Career Changer*](https://www.htmlallthethings.com/blog-posts/overcoming-job-market-challenges-insights-from-a-successful-career-changer)*.*

#### JavaScriptmas Grand Prize Winners

![Winners](img/12-30-25/Winners.JPG)

Congratulations to the Grand Prize winners, [Ebube](https://x.com/EbubeAkukwe) and [Krishna](https://x.com/CodeKae)! Both winners received a 13‚Äù MacBook Air M3, merch from both MDN and Scrimba and lifetime access to Scrimba Pro! As JavaScriptmas is raffle-based, the two winners were drawn randomly, not based on their current coding skills.

I believe lifetime access to Scrimba Pro is the best prize, as it continually offers FREE education! With their new computers, MDN and Scrimba gear, and Scrimba Pro membership, I am sure Ebube and Krishna will continue to learn web development in style!
