### What is JavaScriptmas?

JavaScriptmas is a festive coding event hosted by Scrimba from December 1st to 24th. Each day, you will get a new JavaScript challenge to help improve your coding skills, and you can win prizes! You can submit each valid challenge solution twice for two chances of winning! Since it's a raffle, it's fair for developers of any coding level, as it doesn't depend on skill.

To submit your challenge solution, click "Submit Solution" to save your work, which will automatically enter you into the Grand Prize draw. For an additional chance to win, click the "Share" button to spread the JavaScriptmas cheer on X and/or LinkedIn‚Äîthey will select a second lucky winner from the social posts! The more challenges you solve, the better your chances of winning the grand prize, so keep submitting!

**On December 24th, they will be choosing two lucky Grand Prize winners who will each receive:**

* A 13‚Äù **MacBook** Air M3
    
* Merch from **MDN** and **Scrimba**
    
* Lifetime Scrimba Pro access
    

*Join the fun and improve your JavaScript skills this holiday season!*

#### **Community highlights**

In the spirit of the festive holiday season, I enjoy showcasing others' work in the community highlights section of my JavaScriptmas articles! I'll be searching X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and the Scrimba Discord channel for "outstanding" submissions by fellow participants to feature. üéâ

#### **My solutions**

As I do every year, I will participate in JavaScriptmas and share my solutions on social media. I will provide links to the Scrims in these coverage articles as I complete the challenges. üíª

Carl Storms lives up to his name by wowing us with his winter wonderland snow ‚Äústorm‚Äù globe! The Day 6 challenge, ‚Äú**Snow Globe Animation**,‚Äù involves making snowflakes fall inside a snow globe. Each snowflake must have a random starting position, animation duration, and size.

With Carl‚Äôs addition of¬†**gentle shake**¬†and¬†**hard shake**¬†buttons, you can now emulate a full-blown snowstorm within the snow globe! Clicking the shake buttons achieves a stretch goal by animating the snow globe's movement and making the swirling snowflakes burst into a frenzy!

**Carl completed additional stretch goals by adding buttons to start and resume the snowfall and change the snowflakes, allowing users to choose from Christmas candies, snowmen, or gift emojis. Well done, Carl!**

#### **Lynjai Jimenez (**[**@imdesignsllc**](https://x.com/imdesignsllc)**)**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733875270015/9e850a3a-88d0-48cc-96c2-c3381406c9a8.jpeg align="center")

Lynjai Jimenez has once again impressed the JavaScriptmas community, this time by adding video animation to the Day 9 challenge, ‚Äú**Which recipe should Grandma make**?‚Äù

Has TikTok runied Christmas? This challenge involves helping Grandma update her recipes to accommodate her grandchildren‚Äôs new food preferences, which resulted from their following of TikTok influencers! Finding a recipe for Grandma requires filtering recipes according to her grandchildren's preferences, which include recipes with at least one ingredient they like and excluding those with ingredients they now dislike.

**Lynjai solved the JavaScript portion of the coding challenge, but what caught everyone's eye was her addition of the delightful dancing gingerbread girl video displayed as the background of her project!**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733870520155/7627e05e-cb66-4cc9-9214-5018cf078e16.jpeg align="center")

To set a video as a background, Lynjai first added the video to the images folder. She then used the `<video>` element with `autoplay`, `muted`, and `loop` attributes for seamless playback and applied the class `video-background` for styling. The `<source>` tag specifies the path and type of the video file, ensuring proper display.

```xml
  <video autoplay muted loop class="video-background">
      <source src="./images/gingergirl.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
```

**While TikTok may have ruined Grandma‚Äôs Christmas recipes, the TikTok dancing gingerbread girl video background has delightfully resonated with the JavaScriptmas community! Wonderful work, Lynjai!**

**Urvashi**, also known as **The Code Dose**, recorded a YouTube video covering how to solve the Day 10 challenge of making a ‚Äú**Christmas Flag in CSS**.‚Äú

Before tackling the JavaScriptmas challenge, Urvashi provides a quick pre-requisite CSS art tutorial, where she teaches how to create basic shapes. She introduces a handy tool, the [CSS clip-path maker](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/), which allows you to choose from premade shapes, such as a triangle, by copying the selected shape‚Äôs clip-path. You can also create clip paths with this tool by simply pointing, clicking, and dragging!

```css
clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 0% 100%, 100% 100%);
```

Urvashi also demonstrates how to combine simple shapes to create more complex shapes, which is crucial for solving the Day 10 JavaScriptmas challenge. She illustrates how to make a heart shape, first with pen and graph paper and then with code, combining three divs within a container.

**After her CSS art tutorial, Urvashi skillfully and artistically steps through solving the challenge of making a Santa Clause flag. She then goes above and beyond by creating an animated version on Codepen! Outstanding work, Urvashi!**

#### Daniel Laera ([@daniellaera](https://x.com/daniellaera))

Daniel Laera skillfully steps through solving the Day 11 challenge, ‚Äú**Card Matching Game,**¬†‚Äú in a Livestream YouTube video!

The Card Matching Game challenge is a classic "Find the Pair" game with a festive Christmas theme. In this game, players reveal cards by clicking on them. When a player reveals one card, it remains visible until a second card is revealed. If the two revealed cards match, they stay visible for the remainder of the game. However, if the cards do not match, they are flipped back to their hidden state. To add an element of unpredictability, the cards are shuffled at the beginning of each game, ensuring a fresh and engaging experience every time.

**Daniel solved the Card Matching Game challenge by implementing a series of functions to manage the game's logic. The** `shuffleArray` **function is used to randomize the order of the emoji pairs, ensuring a fresh game each time. Upon loading the document, the game board is populated with eight cards, each representing a pair of emojis. These cards are initially displayed with a question mark and are revealed upon clicking.**

```javascript
// Shuffle logic
function shuffleArray(array) {
  for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
  }
  return array;
}
```

**The** `handleCardClick` **function manages the card reveal process. It prevents interaction with already revealed cards and handles the logic for matching pairs. When a card is clicked, it is revealed, and if it matches the previously revealed card, both remain visible. If not, they are hidden again after a short delay. The game tracks matched pairs, and upon finding all pairs, it declares a win. The** `resetCards` **function resets the game state after each attempt, allowing for continued play until all matches are found.**

```javascript
// Handle card click logic
function handleCardClick(ev) {
  if (lockBoard) return; // Prevent clicks during timeout logic

  const clickedCard = ev.target;
  if (clickedCard.classList.contains('revealed')) return; // Prevent clicking already revealed cards

  clickedCard.classList.add('revealed');
  clickedCard.textContent = clickedCard.getAttribute('data-emoji');

  if (!firstCard) {
    firstCard = clickedCard;
    return;
  }

  secondCard = clickedCard;
  lockBoard = true;

  if (firstCard.getAttribute('data-emoji') === secondCard.getAttribute('data-emoji')) {
    // Match found
    matchedPairs++;
    resetCards();
    if (matchedPairs === 4) {
      alert('You win!');
    }
  } else {
    // Not a match
    setTimeout(() => {
      firstCard.classList.remove('revealed');
      firstCard.textContent = '?';
      secondCard.classList.remove('revealed');
      secondCard.textContent = '?';
      resetCards();
    }, 1000);
  }
}
```

**Be sure** **to watch the YouTube video to see how the entire code for this challenge was developed from the ground up. Great job, Daniel!**
