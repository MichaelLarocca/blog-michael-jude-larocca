### What is JavaScriptmas?

JavaScriptmas is a festive coding event hosted by Scrimba from December 1st to 24th. Each day, you will get a new JavaScript challenge to help improve your coding skills, and you can win prizes! You can submit each valid challenge solution twice for two chances of winning! Since it's a raffle, it's fair for developers of any coding level, as it doesn't depend on skill.

To submit your challenge solution, click "Submit Solution" to save your work, which will automatically enter you into the Grand Prize draw. For an additional chance to win, click the "Share" button to spread the JavaScriptmas cheer on X and/or LinkedIn‚Äîthey will select a second lucky winner from the social posts! The more challenges you solve, the better your chances of winning the grand prize, so keep submitting!

**On December 24th, they will be choosing two lucky Grand Prize winners who will each receive:**

* A 13‚Äù **MacBook** Air M3
    
* Merch from **MDN** and **Scrimba**
    
* Lifetime Scrimba Pro access
    

*Join the fun and improve your JavaScript skills this holiday season!*

#### **Berat (**[**@BeratSakipi**](https://x.com/beratsakipi)**)**

![Berat](img/Berat.png)

Berat solved the day one Christmas List challenge and explained in detail how each part of his wishlist variable works. He used JavaScript‚Äôs `trim`, `split`, `filter`, `join`, and `toLowerCase` to help prepare unique items to enter into the Christmas List, including trimming out troublesome white spaces!

Next, with the wishlist variable ready, Berat uses the JavaScript `includes` method to check if a duplicate item is already in the list array before adding the new item.

```javascript
// Function to check item is not duplicate
function checkDuplicate() {
    const itemText = itemInput.value
    // trimming the spaces out of the sentence before checking if it included in the 'listArr' array
    const wishListItem = itemText.trim() // trim the leading and trailing empty spaces
                                 .split(' ') // split every word and possible empty space inside the string into an array of words and spaces
                                 .filter(str => str !== '') // take only the words
                                 .join(' ') // and join them with one space inbetween
                                 .toLowerCase() // transform the word/sentence to lowercase letters
    // Checking if there is an input and if that input value is not included in the 'listArr' array
    if (wishListItem && !listArr.includes(wishListItem)) {
        listArr.push(wishListItem)
        renderList()
    }
}
```

Berat also solved the delete button stretch goal, as you can see in the code block below. Great job, Berat!

```javascript
// Function to add an item to the shopping list
function renderList() {
    shoppingList.innerHTML = ''
    listArr.forEach((gift, index) => {
        const listItem = document.createElement('li')
        listItem.textContent = gift
        
        const deleteItemBtn = document.createElement('button')
        deleteItemBtn.textContent = 'Delete Item'
        deleteItemBtn.classList.add('delete-gift-btn')
        deleteItemBtn.id = `delete-gift-btn`
        
        const giftContainer = document.createElement('div')
        giftContainer.classList.add('gift-container')
        
        deleteItemBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
            listArr.splice(index, 1)
            renderList()
        })
        
        giftContainer.appendChild(listItem)
        giftContainer.appendChild(deleteItemBtn)
        shoppingList.appendChild(giftContainer)
    })
    itemInput.value = ''; // Clear the input field
}
```
