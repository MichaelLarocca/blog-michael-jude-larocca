[Carl Storms](https://github.com/TheBIMsider)¬†went above and beyond when solving the Day 4 challenge, ‚Äú**Christmas Movie Emoji Quiz**,‚Äú by adding a common movie name variation functionality to accommodate close guesses and deploying it from GitHub! This coding challenge asks participants to create an app that tests players' ability to identify Christmas movies from emoji clues. Players are given three guesses per movie, with feedback provided after each attempt.

**Carl first completed the required challenge by developing a dynamic game that randomly selects emoji sets from a predefined list, ensuring each film is used only once. Then, he imaginatively wrote code for smart title comparison functionality that accounts for common variations and uses a similarity algorithm to accept close matches, enhancing the game's flexibility. Well done, Carl!**

#### Kirsty [(@km\_fsdev)](twitter.com/km_fsdev)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733439375835/780bd9cf-c440-4b1e-9fb4-7aa48ec4d491.jpeg align="center")

For the day five challenge, "**Find The Anagrams**," Kirsty improved her coding skills by broadening her current understanding of Regex; after all, that's what coding challenges are all about!

In this particular challenge, you're responsible for hosting a quiz at a family gathering. With a list of anagrams, your task is to identify and filter out incorrect pairs using a JavaScript function. This challenge ignores the spaces, so phrases like "Be The Helm" are valid anagrams of "Bethlehem."

*Regex, or regular expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, often used for pattern matching within strings.*

**Below is Kirsty‚Äôs code, along with detailed instructions on how it works:**

```javascript
let anagrams = [
    ["Can Assault", "Santa Claus"],
    ["Refreshed Erudite Londoner", "Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer"],
    ["Frosty The Snowman", "Honesty Warms Front"],
    ["Drastic Charms", "Christmas Cards"],
    ["Congress Liar", "Carol Singers"],
    ["The Tin Glints", "Silent Night"],
    ["Be The Helm", "Bethlehem"],
    ["Is Car Thieves", "Christmas Eve"]
];

function findAnagrams(array) {
    return array.filter((el) => {
        let lowerCaseAndSmushedArr = el.map((el) => el.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, ""));
        let sortedItems = lowerCaseAndSmushedArr.map((el) => el.split("").sort().join(""));
        return sortedItems[0] === sortedItems[1];
    });
}

let isAnAnagram = findAnagrams(anagrams);

console.log(isAnAnagram);
[['Can Assault', 'Santa Claus'], ['Refreshed Erudite Londoner', 'Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer'], ['Congress Liar', 'Carol Singers'], ['Be The Helm', 'Bethlehem']]
```

1. **Data Structure**: You have an array of arrays called `anagrams`, where each sub-array contains two strings that are potential anagrams.
    
2. **Function Definition**: The function `findAnagrams` takes an array as an argument and returns a filtered version of that array.
    
3. **Filtering Logic**:
    
    * The `filter` method is used to iterate over each pair of strings in the `anagrams` array.
        
    * For each pair, the `map` method is applied to convert both strings to lowercase and remove all spaces using `toLowerCase()` and `replace(/\s+/g, "")`.
        
    * The processed strings are then split into individual characters, sorted alphabetically, and joined back into strings using `split(""), sort(), and join("")`.
        
    * The sorted strings are compared. If they are identical, it means the original strings are anagrams, and the pair is kept in the filtered array.
        
4. **Result**: The `findAnagrams` function returns an array of pairs that are true anagrams. This result is stored in `isAnAnagram`.
    
5. **Output**: The `console.log(isAnAnagram);` statement prints the filtered list of anagram pairs to the console.
    

*Kirsty‚Äôs code solution effectively filters out any pairs that are not anagrams by comparing the sorted character sequences of the strings!*

**Keep up the fantastic work, Kirsty, and Merry JavaScriptmas!** üéÑ

#### Digbijaya Lenka [@DigbijayaL](https://x.com/digbijayal)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733589100152/d282d12a-9af9-4a8c-824f-cf8390628a46.jpeg align="center")

Digbijaya Lenka took a different approach to solving Day Seven's ‚Äú**SaaS Landing Page**‚Äù challenge. In this UI/UX Design challenge, coders are asked to write HTML and CSS code to complete it. However, Digbijaya opted out of CSS and tackled the challenge using Tailwind instead!

[*Tailwind CSS*](https://tailwindcss.com/) *is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs without leaving their HTML. Unlike traditional CSS, which requires writing custom styles, Tailwind provides a set of utility classes that can be directly applied to HTML elements. This approach enables rapid prototyping and design consistency, as developers can compose complex designs by combining these utility classes. Tailwind's flexibility and efficiency make it a popular choice for developers looking to streamline their styling process and maintain a clean, maintainable codebase.*

**To use Tailwind in the JavaScriptmas challenge, Digbijaya added the following script tag, which is used to include Tailwind CSS in a web project directly from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).**

```xml
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733589116595/9d919526-029f-4da2-8f07-b82b0673ac05.jpeg align="center")

*The code block below shows that the ‚ÄúOn-chain Record‚Äù div uses Tailwind CSS to style a card component with a clean and modern design.*

```xml
<div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg  flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
    <div class="p-4"><i class="fa-brands fa-cloudscale text-4xl text-red-700"></i></div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-600 ">On-chain Record</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600">Each gift is minted as an NFT on our decentralized protocol, creating a
        permanent, tamper-proof record.</p>
    <a href="#on-chain-record" class="text-red-500 hover:underline mt-4 inline-block">Learn more</a>
</div>
```

**Here's how the Tailwind classes work:**

* `bg-white`: Sets the background color of the card to white.
    
* `p-6`: Applies padding of 1.5rem (24px) around the card, creating space between the content and the card's edges.
    
* `rounded-lg`: Rounds the corners of the card, giving it a softer, more visually appealing look.
    
* `shadow-lg`: Adds a large shadow to the card, providing a sense of depth and elevation.
    
* `flex flex-col justify-center items-center`: Uses Flexbox to arrange the card's content in a column, centering the items both vertically and horizontally.
    
* `p-4`: Adds padding of 1rem (16px) around the icon, ensuring it has space within its container.
    
* `text-4xl text-red-700`: Sets the icon's font size to 4xl and its color to a dark red, making it prominent and visually striking.
    
* `text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-600`: Styles the heading with a 2xl font size, bold weight, a bottom margin of 1rem (16px), and a red color, making it stand out.
    
* `text-gray-600`: Colors the paragraph text in a medium gray, ensuring readability while maintaining a subtle appearance.
    

**Digbijaya used Tailwind exclusively for the entire project, and you can see in his code that he commented out the entire CSS file! He demonstrates once again that there are many ways to tackle programming challenges. Great work, Digbijaya!**
