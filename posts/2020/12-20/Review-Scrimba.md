## With Scrimba, you don't just learn how to code. You also become part of a community.

### What is Scrimba?  
Scrimba is an online coding school that offers free courses as well as paid. 

I've been a member for quite some time now, so I was one of the first members to enroll for their new "[Front-End Developer Carrer Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend)."

Scrimba awards Students with a certificate and a graduate badge upon completing the Front-End Developer Carrer Path. I am looking forward to showcasing them in my portfolio.

I am currently halfway through this career path, and I have already completed many of their courses.

### Scrimba has a unique and engaging learning platform.
Scrimba has an exclusive and unique platform for online learning. They call them "scrims."

A "scrim" is an instructional coding video that can be paused and edited by a user. The user can then save the edited code they created for use later and then continue the screencast.

[Scrimba's screencasts](https://scrimba.com/scrim/cJpvbMUB) are remarkable. It truly is, as they advertise, a next-generation platform for learning how to code. 

While I'm learning on other coding platforms, I find myself frequently "clicking" on their coding videos, expecting them to stop so that I can edit the code. Scrimba has spoiled me!

### They have exceptional teachers.
Scrimba has recruited top YouTube content creators to teach their courses. To name a few, you will find talents such as **Gary Simon, Kevin Powell, Ania Kubow, Cassidy Williams, James Quick, Jesse Hall,** and of course, you will find my favorite teacher, **Dylan Israel!**

### They have a thriving Discord community.

What is [Discord](https://discord.com/)? Discord is an application that provides voice, video, and text for its users to communicate. People use it to chat, hang out, and stay close with their friends and communities.


So far, I'm having an excellent experience with the Scrimba Discord community. 

To encourage student participation on their Discord channel, they award weekly medals to each study group. The more each group gets engaged on their Discord channel by posting, sharing, and helping each other, the higher the rank medal they receive. 

*This week our study group "The Booleans" won our first gold medal!*

### They have a friendly and encouraging staff.
Scrimba also has friendly and encouraging staff.

Leanne is on their Discord channel daily, helping and encouraging students. She deserves a raise!

On several occasions, Leanne brought my work to the teachers' attention and the CEO **Per Borgen**! As a result, my projects were reviewed and positively commented on, which is very encouraging!

Booker from Scrimba took the time to review my code from one of their challenge projects, provide encouraging feedback, and then directed me to his instructional videos to further study the topics. Per Borgen, you also need to give Booker a raise!
