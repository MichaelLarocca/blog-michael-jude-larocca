Did you ever wonder if it was possible to teach yourself how to code and then land a six-figure job?

Dylan Israel accomplished this within five years.

When I first considered learning how to code, I did not personally know any web developers. Also, no one else that I knew was interested in learning how to become one. So I started a self-taught coding journey on my own.

I researched colleges, boot camps, and online coding schools. For me, the most viable option was an online course.

After deciding on what learning direction to take, I looked into the certifications offered online. However, I wasn't sure if a web developer certification was worth attaining.

Then, I came across this video. It inspired me to start learning and to earn the [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org) Responsive Web Design  certification.

 Since then, I've been following Dylan's YouTube channel [Coding Tutorials 360](https://www.youtube.com/user/pizzapokerguy87). I find it to be educating, informative, and entertaining.

### Self-Taught or Not Podcast

![Self-Taught or Not Podcast](img/Self-Taught-or-Not.jpg)

Dylan is also a host, along with [Erik Hanchett](https://www.youtube.com/c/programwitherik), on a podcast titled [Self-Taught or Not](https://www.selftaughtornot.com).

I've learned so much about the programming industry from the Self-Taught or Not podcast. 

Since I am a self-taught programmer and currently not employed as a developer, this program gives me great insight into the industry. 

It is great to hear the perspective of both a self-taught developer and a traditionally trained developer on a broad range of topics covered in the podcast.

I've listened to both seasons that they released, and I am looking forward to the upcoming third season.

Recently, Amazon hired Dylan, offering him a six-figure salary. It is awe-inspiring. 

Since Dylan is self-taught, it shows what is possible for other aspiring self-taught developers.


Dylan has courses available on Scrimba, Thinkster, SkillShare, & Udemy.
