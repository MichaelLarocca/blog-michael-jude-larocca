### The JavaScriptmas course is a brilliant idea. I'll explain why I believe so with a few questions and answers.

---

**Question**: Would you like to take part in a twenty-four-day coding challenge that progressively gets more difficult, which will help you become a better web developer?

**Answer**: *No.*

---
**Question**: Would you like to participate in a festive twenty-four-day event, where you can sit down and code with your favorite holiday drink, which will help you become a better web developer?

**Answer**: *Maybe.*

---
**Question**: Did we mention a daily raffle, where participants could win a one-year membership, and a grand prize winner awarded with a $1,000 and lifetime membership to Scrimba?

### My favorite challenge
***Day 8, The Rolling Dice***


My favorite challenge was The Rolling Dice. In this challenge, we needed to create a working rolling die.

To pass the challenge, we had to program the die to roll every time a user clicked it. When the program runs, a written message displays the rolled number, and the die reflects the new number.

As a bonus challenge, they instructed us to improve the overall style. I was delighted to see that Leanne from Scrimba complimented my styling!

I enjoyed this challenge because I created something that I can incorporate into a JavaScript game!

![Day 13](img/Day-13.png)
### My hardest challenge
***Day 13, (Extract Each Kth)***

<!-- #### W.T.F. (What, This Function?) -->

I was on a winning streak until I hit "**Lucky 13**". It was a challenge that I was trying to solve by comparing two arrays.

The first array was already provided and had the numbers **1** through **10**. The second array I created, with a formula, contained numbers **3**, **6**, and **9**.
```javascript
	const numberDivide = index /  nums.length * 10;

    for(let i = 0; i < numberDivide; i++) {
        arrayCompare.push(total + numberDivide);
        total += numberDivide;
    }
    // arrayCompare now equals [3,6,9]
```

To solve the challenge, we had to return an array containing the numbers from the first provided array that **excluded** specific numbers; in this case, numbers **3**, **6**, and **9**. The result needed to be:
```javascript
	arrayAnswer = [1,2,4,5,7,8,10]
```

Over and over again! **W.T.F.?** Which in this case represents, "Which, This Function?" I keep trying various functions to solve the problem. 

Eventually, I solved the challenge using the method **includes()**.
```javascript
	let checkForNumbers = arrayCompare.includes(nums[i]);
```

I looped through the length of the first array. I compared **each** item in the first array to **all** of the second array items during the loop. If the includes method returned false, I pushed the item from the first array into the **answer array**.
```javascript
    for(let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

        let checkForNumbers = arrayCompare.includes(nums[i]);

        if(checkForNumbers === false) {
            arrayAnswer.push(nums[i]);
        }
    }
	
```

I passed the challenge by returning the answer array.
```javascript
	 return arrayAnswer;
```

### What I learned

At first, I was disappointed that I was struggling so much with some of the JavaScriptmas challenges. Then I realized that this was a good thing because these challenges showed me the areas of study that I need to improve on.

---

### What I enjoyed

I enjoyed sharing code solutions with my gold medal-winning study group, "**The Booleans!**" 

![The Booleans - gold medal](img/The-Booleans_Gold-Medal.png)

Throughout the JavaScriptmas course, our study group shared their coding solutions on Scrimba's [Discord](https://discord.com/) channel. We explained how our code worked and why we decided to write the program the way we did. 

Sharing and discussing our code made the course an even more educational experience.

We learned together that there are many ways to write a program to solve the same problem. It truly is incredible!
