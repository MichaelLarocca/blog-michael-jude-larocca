![Image Discord Advent Calender](img/12-27-20/Advent.png)

The course originated with a question posted on Scrimba's Discord channel, asking the students if they would be interested in an "JavaScript Challenges Advent Calendar."

They received an enthusiastic response from their students and then created the course in just three weeks!
<!-- 
### Students enrolled!

Later in the live stream, Per Borgen brought Dylan's six-figure income and self-taught education to the live stream viewers' attention; Dylan hilariously quotes, ***"I learned in the streets. I'm about that code life!"*** referencing "**Thug life**." I want to buy all the merchandise available with that quote, starting with a coffee mug!

### Some amazing submissions
* Christmas tweet app (Dmitri Frolov)
* Terminal tweet app (Samy Mohamed Mahomoud)
* Roll the 3-dimensional dice (Dave Alger)

![Christmas tweet app - Dmitri](img/12-27-20/Tweet-Dmitri.png)

The [***Christmas tweet app***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co7714bba86a05da955b13c45), created by  **Dmitri Frolov**, was styled very nicely. When you clicked the Tweet button in his program, it made a real tweet!

![Terminal tweet app](img/12-27-20/Terminal-Tweet.png)

The [***Terminal tweet app***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co63c470fb7acea4dd6f836fe), created by **Samy Mohamed Mahomoud**, was also styled very nicely. The project that Samy made looks like an actual command-line terminal. If you look at the details in the interface that he created, he wrote some amusing text. His program also made real tweets!

![Roll the 3-dimensional dice](img/12-27-20/Dice-Dave.png)

The [***Roll the 3-dimensional dice***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co60a4282b9ca0666acef2036), created by **Dave Alger**, was breath-taking. His project received a lot of recognition on Scrimba's JavaScriptmas Discord channel. The die was 3-dimensionally styled, with a red see-through color. When you clicked on the dice, it raises and then spins in 3d! He also created an actual game with it, and when you win, an excellent "Win Screen" that included falling snowflakes is displayed.

A quote from ***Star Wars Episode I*** comes to mind when I hear the name  **Dave Alger**, "We will watch your career with great interest!"

### Community-generated article
* Diana Marin on Hash node
* Sekti Wicaksono on Dev.to
* Michael Larocca's personal blogs

![From Zero to Code](img/12-27-20/FromZeroToCode.png)

**Diana Marin**

Alex Booker sent out an e-mail that included Diana Marin's blog post. He used the blog as an example of how to write one! Diana's blog was the first community written post on "JavaScriptmas" promoted by Scrimba! The article is on Hashnode, and it is receiving a lot of positive feedback.

Diana Marin Wrote an excellent [blog post](https://zerotocode.hashnode.dev/from-zero-to-code-javascriptmas). In the post, Diana quotes, "I feel that my life can begin as many times as I want..." and "My new challenge in life is to walk through the Frontend Developer Path. "

I am excited to see a fellow self-taught X Generation developer. It is very encouraging to know that I'm not alone in starting to learn front end web development at this stage in my life.

---

![Sekti](img/12-27-20/Sekti.png)

**Sekti Wicaksono**

Sekti took a different aproch with blogging. Each JavaScriptmas challenge was coved in detail in seperate [posts](https://dev.to/sekti92).

I believe writing separate posts is a brilliant idea. 

Of course, I had to check out Sekti's solution for day 13, "Extract Each Kth." He made the challenge look easy, providing an elegant solution.

```javascript
function extractEachKth(nums, index) {
   return nums.filter(num => num % index != 0);
}
```

Am I the only student that struggled with this challenge? LOL!

![Michael Larocca](img/12-27-20/MichaelLarocca.png)

**Michael Larocca**

For the third community-generated article, they chose mine! What an honor!

While reviewing my blog, they noted that I posted it on a custom named domain. 

To go into more detail, I decided to make my blog into a fun learning project. To create it, I used a community built Gatsby starter blog, created by [Will Ward](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/willjw3/gatsby-starter-developer-diary), in conjunction with GitHub and Netlify. 

I then set the blog up as a subdomain on my website. 
```
blog.michaeljudelarocca.com
```
I then decided to purchase another custom domain name. I decided on "**selftaughttxg.com.**" Since I am a self-taught X Generation programmer, I came up with a "**play on words**" to my favorite Star Trek series, "**Star Trek TNG (The Next Generation)**." It also pays homage to my favorite podcast, "**Self-Taught or Not.**"

Finally, I set up my purchased selftaughttxg.com domain as an alias to my blog.michaeljudelarocca.com.

![Domains](img/12-27-20/Domains.png)

Scrimba also announced that they recently made me a "**Community Hero**" on their Discord channel! It is a great honor that I appreciated to receive! Thank you, Scrimba!

I was also very appreciative when Dylan gave me a "Shout out" for the [article I wrote on him!](https://selftaughttxg.com/2020/12-20/12-06-2020_TeacherFeature-Dylan_Israel/)

### Students were encouraged to create blogs

Why Blog? Alex from Scrimba explains that creating content and sharing what you are learning is the number one way to improve your communication skills and increases your chance of finding a job you love. He also states that blogging proves your dedication to improving your skills. 

To encourage students to start blogging, Scrimba awarded a certificate and a special Discord badge for those who created one and completed all 24 JavaScriptmas challenges! 

What a brilliant idea Scrimba proposed to their students. If Scrimba could only create a similar proposal, encouraging our children to eat their vegetables!

**I believe it is a big personal step to create a blog and to put yourself out there. So in this article, I am showcasing every JavaScriptmas blog post that my classmates made!**

### GitHub: Scrimba Class of 2020

**(During the JavaScriptmas live stream, I invited anyone interested in working on a collaborative GitHub project I created.)**

As I elaborated in course suggestions on Scrimba's Discord channel, I took the initiative and created a GitHub project for student collaborative practice. As it is an open-source group project, everyone is entitled to add this project to their portfolio! https://github.com/MichaelLarocca/Scrimba-Class-of-2020

### A special thank you from our study group, "The Booleans."

I want to thank Per Borgen, Alex Booker, Leanne, and the Scrimba teachers and staff. I know that the JavaScriptmas course took a lot of work to put together quickly.

### **Conclusion**

Scrimba's JavaScriptmas was an engaging, collaborative, and educational experience for their students. The course encouraged us to code daily for 24 days, share our code on Discord, and challenged us to get out of our "comfort zones" and start blogging!

A proverb comes to mind, "It takes a village to raise a child." With that wisdom, I would like to add that "It takes a community to teach a programmer."

I want to thank the Scrimba community, my classmates, teachers, and the Scrimba staff, which continually help me become the programmer I aspire to be.
