### The only constant is change

James warns us that if we are not open to change and do not pursue change before or when it happens, we will get left behind! This is true in our personal lives and our professional lives.

**In our personal lives, we go through major life events such as:**

* Starting a new job
    
* marriage
    
* Having children
    
* Buying a house
    
* Loss of a loved one
    

**There are transitions in life, and there's always a next step to take. You must embrace your new reality and learn how to handle it to excel in your personal life and career.**

In your personal life, consider taking up new hobbies, seeking support during challenging times, and being open to new experiences. This can lead you to a more fulfilling life.

In our professional lives within the tech industry, technological changes occur. When they do, some embrace these changes with optimism, while others resist them pessimistically. It's in your best interest to choose the optimistic path and keep up with the changes with a growth mindset.

In the tech industry, staying updated with the latest programming languages, attending workshops, taking courses, and participating in communities, including conferences, can help you adapt to fast-paced advancements.

**James has successfully navigated significant transitions in his personal and professional life, attributing his mindset of pursuing happiness as the driving force behind these achievements.**

### How does AI affect learning?

Learning with AI tools has broadened James's horizon of development possibilities. AI accomplishes tasks that James never imagined possible, significantly enhancing his creative potential.

As a teacher, James believes it is more beneficial for beginner developers to learn without AI training wheels, as it takes away from their learning journey. Experiencing errors, needing to fix code that doesn't work as expected, and having to do research are all part of the learning process.

However, James acknowledges that beginner developers using AI tools responsibly, such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), can be empowered to achieve more than they ever could have before.

### Using AI as a source of creativity

James tells us he often uses AI tools as a source of inspiration. When he experiences writer's block, whether it's ideas for content, titles, or abstracts, James utilizes AI to spark creativity, helping him to overcome the obstacles holding him back.

James shares an amazing AI use case of how he successfully prompt-engineered a customized Discord bot that generates and posts engaging discussion questions for his Learn Build Teach community, which enables him to bring more value to his community.

James introduces us to the incredible AI tool [Video Tap](https://videotap.com/), which transforms a video into a blog post. The creator and the founding team happen to be his friends!

As a content creator, James explains that a service like Video Tap is invaluable, allowing him to produce more content than ever!

[***Video Tap***](https://videotap.com/) ***re-purposes your videos for multiple platforms and increases their reach. It's like having a whole marketing team for your videos.***

**Leveraging AI while keeping your voice**

As a content creator, you will benefit the most by utilizing AI to increase your workflow, productivity, and content creation. You will not benefit from having AI create the content for you!

**Since AI tools are widely available to all, now more than ever, you need to make sure the content you create resounds with your voice and personality.**

With the mindset of utilizing AI to increase productivity, you will empower yourself to create more content with less effort while still ensuring your voice resonates in your work.

**Ideas for balancing AI assistance and personal creativity include:**

1. **Use AI for content research and brainstorming:** Employ AI tools to generate ideas and research topics, but add your unique perspective and insights to the content.
    
2. **Edit AI-generated text:** Review and revise AI-generated content to ensure it aligns with your writing style, tone, and personal touch.
    
3. **Combine AI suggestions with original ideas:** Utilize AI-generated suggestions as a starting point, but expand upon them with your own thoughts and experiences.
    
4. **Set boundaries for AI assistance:** Determine the specific areas where AI can be helpful, such as grammar and proofreading, while preserving the creative aspects for yourself.
    
5. **Continuously refine your collaboration with AI:** Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of your AI-assisted workflow and make adjustments to maintain your voice and creativity.

### Where AI falls short

James alleviates our concerns about AI replacing us by clarifying that if AI were 100% accurate all the time, then our worries would indeed be justified. However, AI is far from perfect and frequently provides us with misinformation.

To provide context for his statement, he shares a situation where he worked on a project using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). The AI mistakenly informed him that he was prepared to discuss a topic entirely unrelated to his project!

Once again, James drives his point home that we can't just take the information we receive from AI without question. First and foremost, we need to understand programming languages so that we can effectively use AI as a tool to streamline our work while still identifying and correcting any misinformation we receive from it.
