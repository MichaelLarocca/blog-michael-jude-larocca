### Setting up the environment

First, we need to set up our coding environment.

#### The React environment
For this project, I used the VS Code editor to create a React app with Vite. Afterward, I converted it into a GitHub repository and deployed it on Netlify.

**If you would like to learn how to set up a local React development environment, I wrote the following two beginner-friendly articles:**

* [Create a React Project, Push It to GitHub, and Deploy With Netlify, From the Command Line](https://selftaughttxg.com/2023/03-23/create-a-react-project-push-it-to-github-and-deploy-with-netlify-from-the-command-line/)
