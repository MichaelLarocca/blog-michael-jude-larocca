### What is an executive presence?

Eugene defines an executive presence as the ability to inspire trust and confidence in others, demonstrating that you are capable of handling the job at hand. It involves effectively convincing and influencing people that you possess the skills and expertise necessary to get the job done.

**Key Components of Executive Presence**

* Expertise in your area of specialization
    
* Clear and concise communication skills
    
* Strong leadership abilities
    
* Self-confidence and poise
    
* Robust networking capabilities
    

*Examples of individuals with an executive presence include Gary Simon, a UI/UX Design expert at DesignCourse, and Kevin Powell, a renowned CSS evangelist. Through consistent content creation, both are well-established in their respective field as experts.*

---

### Why build an executive presence?

Eugene explains that hiring in the tech market is experiencing a downturn, leading to increased competition. As a result, you will find yourself competing with other developers for job roles that require the same skill sets.

**You can gain a competitive advantage by being proactive in creating a reputation, which helps you stand out and differentiate yourself from others. Your ultimate goal is to become a sought-after developer, and one of the most effective strategies to accomplish this is by building an executive presence.**

*With a strong executive presence, you increase opportunities for yourself, including attracting top-tier job offers, securing promotions, and establishing yourself as an industry expert.*

### How to build your executive presence?

In the face of a competitive job market, Eugene recommends standing out by developing an executive presence and specializing in the specific skill sets necessary for the positions you seek. To achieve this, you must first select and establish a unique niche, as determining your area of expertise and the skill you want to be recognized for is essential. Then, put yourself out there!

**Stand out and put yourself out there by:**

* Showing up
    
* Building your network
    
* Creating content
    
* LinkedIn and resume

#### Showing up

By consistently attending and actively participating in events while sharing your knowledge and insights, you will establish your executive presence in your areas of expertise. You can achieve this and expand your network by engaging in events like Eugene's Livestreams!

---

#### Building your network

Having a strong network equips you with connections that can significantly increase your chances of advancing your career by securing a job, obtaining a higher-paying position, and unlocking a wealth of employment opportunities.

You can build your network by attending and engaging in events and connecting with other participants at these meetings.

*Eugene shares with us that he quickly secured a new job through his network when he was recently laid off, which emphasizes the importance of building your network!*

---

#### Creating content

You will benefit in many ways by becoming a content creator.

**As a content creator, you will:**

* Become known
    
* Grow your online presence
    
* Grow your network
    
* Improve your communication skills
    
* Have documented examples of your work
    

Eugene advises us first to learn the tech topics ourselves and then create projects and content that teach them to others rather than merely sharing what we are learning on social media.

*Having your work documented provides hiring managers with a sample of your skillset, which can prove to them that you are qualified for a job role before you step into the interview room!*

---

#### LinkedIn and resume

Your LinkedIn profile should be optimized and clearly showcase your skill of expertise.

In your experience section, on your LinkedIn and resume, it is vital to describe what you achieved, not just list your job title. For example, do not just say you are a front-end web developer, write the quantitative value you provided, such as "Reduced website load time by 20% after optimizing JavaScript and CSS, resulting in a 10% increase in user engagement."

---

***Tip:*** *If you're a new developer without experience, you can gain experience to add to your resume by offering your services for free or at a discounted rate through your network.*
