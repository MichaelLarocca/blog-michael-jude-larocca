### **Day 4:** AI Christmas E-card Generator

**Task:**

* Use AI to generate a Christmas joke.
    
* Display the joke in the DOM.
    
![DAY-04](img/12-11-2023/DAY-04.png)

***üîó*** [***My solution for day 4***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co35c4cf1816e0f50380029e1)

This code uses the Hugging Face Inference API to generate a Christmas joke and display it in the document.

The `HfInference` class from the `@huggingface/inference` package is imported at the beginning. An instance of `HfInference` is created with the API key stored in the environment variable `process.env.HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY`.

A reference to the HTML element with the class name 'joke-display' is stored in the `displayEl` variable.

An event listener is added to the HTML element with the id 'window-container'. When this element is clicked, the following actions are performed:

1. The text content of the 'joke-display' element is set to 'Loading...'.
    
2. The styles of the 'left-door' and 'right-door' elements are updated to trigger CSS animations that open the doors.
    
3. The style of the 'joke-display' element is updated to trigger a CSS animation that displays the joke.
    
4. The `textGeneration` method of the `HfInference` instance is called. This method generates a text based on the provided model and inputs. The inputs are set to a string that prompts the model to generate a Christmas joke. The `temperature` option is set to `0.7`, which controls the randomness of the output. A lower temperature results in more focused and consistent output, while a higher temperature results in more diverse and surprising output.
    
5. The `use_cache` option is set to `false` to ensure that the generated text is not cached and is different each time the function is called.
    
6. The generated text is set as the text content of the 'joke-display' element.
    

**This script provides a fun and interactive way to generate Christmas jokes using AI. (However, I don't quite get the joke! "**The Christmas tree is a very good tree**" üòÇ)**

```javascript
import { HfInference } from '@huggingface/inference';
const hf = new HfInference(process.env.HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY);
const displayEl = document.querySelector('.joke-display');

document.getElementById('window-container').addEventListener('click', async function () {
    displayEl.innerText = 'Loading...';

    document.querySelector('.left-door').style = "animation: left-open 0.3s forwards";
    document.querySelector('.right-door').style = "animation: right-open 0.3s forwards";
    document.querySelector('.joke-display').style = "animation: display-joke 0.3s forwards";

    const response = await hf.textGeneration({
        model: 'google/flan-t5-xxl',
        inputs: `Q: Give me a Christmas joke.`,
        temperature: 0.7,
    }, {
        use_cache: false
    });

    displayEl.innerText = response.generated_text;
});
```

### **Day 5: Jeopardy Card Flip**

**Task:**

* The card has two sides and flips front to back on hover
    
* Match styles as closely as possible
    
* CSS only
    
![DAY-05](img/12-11-2023/DAY-05.png)

***üîó*** [***My solution for day 5***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co7f04288a92ab1c880cb9a97)

This CSS code is used to create a flipping card effect on a webpage. It uses several CSS properties to achieve this effect.

The `body` and `html` styles are used to center the card on the page, set the background color, and specify the font color and type.

The `:root` selector is used to define CSS variables which can be used throughout the document. In this case, it sets the colors for the card and font.

The `.card` class sets the size and position of the card. The `perspective` property gives the card a 3D effect when it flips.

The `.card-front` and `.card-back` classes are used to style the front and back of the card. The `backface-visibility` property hides the back of the card when it's not flipped. The `transform-style` property is used to preserve the 3D position of the card when it flips. The `transition` property creates the flipping animation.

The `transform` property in `.card-back` class initially rotates the back of the card by 180 degrees, hiding it from view.

When the card is hovered over, the `.card:hover .card-front` and `.card:hover .card-back` styles rotate the card to show the back of the card and hide the front, creating the flipping card effect.

```css
body, html { 
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color: var(--jeopardy-blue);
  color: var(--font-color-main);
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

:root {
  --jeopardy-blue: #060CE9;
  --font-color-main: #fff;
}

.card {
  position: relative;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  perspective: 1000px;
}

.card-front, .card-back {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 20px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 1px solid var(--font-color-main);
  border-radius: 10px;
  transition: transform 0.8s;
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

.card-front {
  background-color: var(--jeopardy-blue);
}

.card-back {
  background-color: var(--font-color-main);
  color: var(--jeopardy-blue);
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}

.card:hover .card-front {
  transform: rotateY(180deg);
}

.card:hover .card-back {
  transform: rotateY(360deg);
}
```

### **Day 6: Secret Santa**

**Task:**

Write a function to randomly assign each person in an array a "Secret Santa," who is someone else in the array. No one should be assigned to themselves as their own Secret Santa.

```javascript
{Bob: "Carly", Carly: "Alice", Alice: "Dan", Dan: "Ed", Ed: "Ferdinand", Ferdinand: "Ginny", Ginny: "Bob"}
```

***üîó*** [***My solution for day 6***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co78740dba6c48d8bca525027)

This function, `generateSecretSantaPairs`, is designed to organize a Secret Santa gift exchange. It accepts an array of people's names.

1. First, it shuffles the array of names. This is done by swapping each name with another randomly selected name from the array. This ensures that the assignment of Secret Santas is random.
    
2. Then, it creates an empty object, `pairs`, where we will store the final pairs of people and their Secret Santas.
    
3. Next, it loops through the shuffled array of names. For each name, it assigns the next name in the array as their Secret Santa and stores this pair in the `pairs` object. For example, the first person gets the second person as their Secret Santa, the second person gets the third, and so on.
    
4. When it reaches the last person in the array, it assigns them the first person as their Secret Santa. This is what we call "circular assignment".
    
5. Finally, it outputs the `pairs` object which contains the pairs of people and their Secret Santas.
    

**This function ensures that everyone gets a unique Secret Santa and no one is left without a gift. It's a fun and fair way to organize a Secret Santa gift exchange!**

```javascript
const people = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carly", "Dan", "Ed", "Ferdinand", "Ginny"]

function generateSecretSantaPairs(arr) {
    // Shuffle array
    for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        let j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
    }

    let pairs = {};

    // Circular assignment
    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if(i === arr.length - 1) {
            pairs[arr[i]] = arr[0];
        } else {
            pairs[arr[i]] = arr[i + 1];
        }
    }

    console.log(pairs);
    return pairs;
}    

generateSecretSantaPairs(people)
```

### **Day 7: Christmas Present Wishlist**

**Task:**

* Iterate over the wishlist array.
    
* Dynamically render your wishlist from the array.
    
* Style the wishlist with CSS.

![DAY-07](img/12-11-2023/DAY-07.png)

***üîó*** [***My solution for day 7***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/coeb8439398690ca6ab2362a8)

This JavaScript code is used to dynamically generate a wishlist on a webpage. It consists of an array of wishlist items and a JavaScript function that creates and appends these items to the webpage.

The `wishlist` array contains five items that you wish for. These items are strings and represent the names of the gifts you want.

The `wishlistItems` constant is a collection of all HTML elements with the class name "wishlist".

The `wishlist.forEach` loop goes through each item in the wishlist array. For each item, it does the following:

1. Creates a new `li` element using `document.createElement("li")`.
    
2. Sets the text content of this `li` element to the current item in the array.
    
3. Adds the class "wishlist-item" to the `li` element.
    
4. Appends this `li` element to the first element in the `wishlistItems` collection.
    

**By the end of the loop, each item in the wishlist array is transformed into an li element and added to the webpage.**

```javascript
const wishlist = [
  "ATARI 2600+ Console",
  "Stack of Atari 2600 games",
  "Classic Atari T-Shirt",
  "Walkman with Retro Mixtapes",
  "Board Game Twilight Imperium",
];

const wishlistItems = document.getElementsByClassName("wishlist");

wishlist.forEach((item)=>{
  const listItem = document.createElement("li");
  listItem.textContent = item;
  listItem.classList = "wishlist-item";
  wishlistItems[0].appendChild(listItem);
})
```

**The following CSS code block styles a webpage with a wishlist.**

The `body` selector styles the entire webpage. It sets the body to fill the entire height of the viewport (`100vh`). The `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` properties center the content both vertically and horizontally. The `background` property sets a background image that covers the entire body.

The `.wishlist` selector styles a block element. It sets the width to `300px`, adds a dotted border, and a box shadow for a 3D effect.

The `.wishlist-item` selector styles each item in the wishlist. It sets the color to white, centers the text, and makes the text bold. It also uses flexbox to center the content within each list item.

The `.wishlist-item:nth-child(odd)` and `.wishlist-item:nth-child(even)` selectors add a red and green background color to odd and even-numbered list items, respectively.

```css
body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: 'Mountains of Christmas', serif;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px red, -2px -2px 1px black;
    color: blanchedalmond;
    background: url("https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/11/09/15/32/christmas-6781762_1280.jpg") no-repeat center center;
    background-size: cover;
}

.wishlist {
    width: 300px;
    border: 10px dotted blanchedalmond;
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
}   

.wishlist-item {
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px black;
    font-weight: bolder;
    font-size: 22px;
    list-style-type: square;
    height: 50px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

.wishlist-item:nth-child(odd) {
    background-color: red
}

.wishlist-item:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: green;
}
```

### **Day 8: Animated Progress Bar**

**Task:**

* Build a CSS animation of a progress bar filling to 100%. The animation should run continuously, with a small pause when the bar is filled 100%.
    
* The progress begins red, turns blue, at 50%, and green when complete.
    
* CSS only!
    
![DAY-08](img/12-11-2023/DAY-08.png)    

***üîó*** [***My solution for day 8***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co8bc4cc199bc9a4febe1dc8e)

This code creates an animated progress bar that changes color from red to blue to green as it fills up with a candy cane background!

The `:root` section defines color variables for the progress bar. The `body` section styles the webpage, including setting a Christmas-themed background image and aligning content in the center.

The `h1` section styles the title with a large font size, white color, and a shadow effect. The `.container` section styles the container of the progress bar.

The `.progress-bar` section styles the progress bar itself, giving it a width, height, and a striped background. The `.progress-status` section is where the animation is applied to create a filling effect.

The `@keyframes progress` section defines the animation, dictating that the progress bar should start at a width of 0% (empty), then increase to a width of 50% (half full), and finally reach a width of 100% (fully filled). The bar's color changes at each stage, going from red to blue to green.

```css
:root {
    --progressbar-bg: lightgrey;
    --start: red;
    --middle: blue;
    --finish: green;
}

body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    background-image: url("https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/12/19/22/00/christmas-3884891_1280.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    font-family: 'Mountains of Christmas'; 
}

h1 {
    font-size: 50px;
    color: white;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px black, -2px -2px 2px red;
}

.container {
    border: 5px solid black;
    border-radius: 25px;
    box-shadow: 3px 3px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
    width: 300px;
    margin: 50px auto;
}

.progress-bar {
    width: 100%;
    height: 30px;
    background: repeating-linear-gradient(
        45deg,
        white,
        white 10px,
        red 10px,
        red 20px
    );
    border-radius: 15px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

.progress-status {
    height: 100%;
    width: 0;
    background: var(--start);
    animation: progress 3s infinite;
}

@keyframes progress {
    0% {
        width: 0;
        background: var(--start);
    }
    50% {
        width: 50%;
        background: var(--middle);
    }
    100% {
        width: 100%;
        background: var(--finish);
    }
}
```

### **Day 9:** AI Christmas E-card Generator

**Task:**

* Use AI to generate an image for a Christmas e-card
    
* Render the image to the DOM

![DAY-09](img/12-11-2023/DAY-09.png)
    
***üîó*** [***My solution for day 9***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co19843139fc60c047c09cc9c)

**I thought it would be entertaining to modify the provided code, transforming it into a Star Wars-themed card! I used the Hugging Face API, and I utilized Scrimba's method of storing environment variables.**

**My prompt:**  
*"Create a festive image that captures the spirit of the Star Wars universe's "Hope Day". The scene should be set on the lush, forested home planet of Chewbacca, Kashyyyk. Specifically, it should depict Chewbacca and his family, including his wife Malla, his son Lumpy, and his father Itchy, celebrating Hope Day together. They should be on a balcony of their towering treehouse, as seen in the Star Wars Christmas Special and the movie Revenge of the Sith. The family should be joyously engaged in typical holiday activities, such as exchanging gifts or sharing a meal. The background should feature the dense, towering Wroshyr trees of Kashyyyk, bathed in the warm, golden light of sunset. To add a festive touch, the treehouse and surrounding trees could be decorated with glowing lanterns or strands of lights. The card should embody the warmth, joy, and hope that characterizes both the holiday season and the spirit of Star Wars' "Hope Day"."*

**This script utilizes the Hugging Face Inference API to generate an image based on user input.**

First, it imports the `HfInference` class from the `@huggingface/inference` package. This class provides methods to interact with the Hugging Face Inference API.

Then, it gets references to several HTML elements: a dialog modal, an image container, an input form, and a user input field.

The `generateImage` function is an asynchronous function that creates an instance of `HfInference` with a provided API key. It then calls the `textToImage` method on this instance, passing in an object that specifies the model to use, the inputs to provide to the model, and any additional parameters. This method returns a Blob representing the generated image. The function then converts this Blob to a data URL and returns it.

`blobToDataURL` is a helper function that converts a Blob to a data URL. It creates a new `FileReader`, sets up event listeners to resolve or reject the Promise when the read operation is complete, and starts reading the Blob as a data URL.

The event listener for the 'submit' event on the input form prevents the default form submission behavior, closes the dialog modal, and sets the inner HTML of the image container to a loading spinner. It then calls `generateImage`, waits for it to complete, and sets the `src` attribute of an `img` element in the image container to the returned data URL. Finally, it clears the user input field.

The `show` method is called on the dialog modal to display it when the script runs.

```javascript
import { HfInference } from '@huggingface/inference'

const dialogModal = document.getElementById('dialog-modal')
const imageContainer = document.getElementById('image-container')
const inputForm = document.getElementById('input-form');
const userInput = document.getElementById('user-input');

async function generateImage() {
    const inference = new HfInference(process.env.HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY);
    const blob = await inference.textToImage({
        model: "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2",
        inputs: userInput.value,
        parameters: {
            negative_prompt: "blurry",
        }
    });

    return await blobToDataURL(blob);
}

function blobToDataURL(blob) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onloadend = () => resolve(reader.result);
        reader.onerror = reject;
        reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
    });
}

inputForm.addEventListener('submit', async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    dialogModal.close();
    imageContainer.innerHTML = '<div class="spinner"></div>';
    imageContainer.innerHTML = `<img src="${await generateImage()}" alt="${userInput.value}">`; 
    userInput.value = '';
});

dialogModal.show();
```
