### JavaScriptmas 2023

#### **What is JavaScriptmas?**

JavaScriptmas is a¬†**FREE**¬†annual event comprising 24 coding challenges hosted by the online coding school [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). Most of the coding challenges are JavaScript, but this year, there will be a few CSS challenges, and some using AI tools! üéÑ

#### **What level of coder do you need to be to participate?**

Even if you are starting to learn JavaScript, you can participate. For hints, you can tap into the community, and of course, you can always use Google to help you get to your solution. There will also be Discord channels for the challenges, as well as for FAQs. You can also check out the topic in [Scrimba's forum](https://forum.scrimba.com/). üíª

#### **JavaScriptmas prize rules**

Each day, you can complete the challenge by midnight UTC, and share your VALID/working solution on Twitter/X for a chance to win a prize! (You can easily post your submission via the share solution button on your Scrim). The prizes consist of 24 Annual Scrimba Pro subscriptions worth $200 and 1 grand prize winner awarded a Mackbook Air M2 worth $1,100! All winners will be announced during the JavaScriptmas YouTube Livestream event on December 24th. üéÅ

Thea solved the day 1 challenge Countdown to Christmas challenge in style! She included a festive font and an animated snowing background! With the included Christmas tree emoji, the overall effect reminds me of the famous Charlie Brown Christmas special! Well done, Thea!

### **Day 1 :** Countdown to Christmas

**Task:**

* Get today's date (you only need the day).
    
* Calculate remaining days.
    
* Display remaining days in countdownDisplay.
    

![DAY-01](img/12-04-2023/DAY-01.png)

***üîó*** [***My solution for day 1***](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co80c4e67af8077afdabe0297)

**The** `renderCountdown` **function I wrote calculates the number of days left until Christmas and displays the result in an HTML element with the ID "countdown-display."**

**Steps:**

1. Create a `today` variable, which is the current date and time.
    
2. Extract the current year from `today` and store it in the `currentYear` variable.
    
3. Create a `christmasDay` variable, which is a new Date object representing Christmas Day (December 25) of the current year.
    
4. Calculate the difference between `christmasDay` and `today` in milliseconds, then divide the result by the number of milliseconds in a day (1000 \* 60 \* 60 \* 24) to get the number of days left. The result is rounded up using `Math.ceil()` to ensure it's a whole number.
    
5. Select the HTML element with the ID "countdown-display" and update its innerHTML to display the `daysLeft` value.
    

*The goal is to get the difference between Christmas Day and today in milliseconds, convert it to days, and round up to get a whole number of days left until Christmas.*

```javascript
const countdownDisplay = document.getElementById("countdown-display")

function renderCountdown(){
    const today = new Date();
    const currentYear = today.getFullYear();
    const christmasDay = new Date(currentYear, 11, 25);
    const daysLeft = Math.ceil((christmasDay - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    
    const countdownDisplay = document.getElementById("countdown-display");
    countdownDisplay.innerHTML = daysLeft;
}
 
renderCountdown()
```
