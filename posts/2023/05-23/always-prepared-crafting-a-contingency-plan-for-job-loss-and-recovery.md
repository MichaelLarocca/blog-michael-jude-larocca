### Don't take it personal
Taylor informs us that in the current job market, layoffs often result from budget constraints and overhiring rather than being a reflection of an individual's performance.

Unfortunately, we cannot control the job market situation, so Taylor urges us to do our best not to take a layoff personally.

### Take the next day off
*It's best not to be emotional when job searching!*

Taking the next day off is essential to process what happened and to regain your composure. Allow yourself this brief break before beginning your new job search.

### Prose, cons, & what you want
*Taylor informs you that most job seekers have yet to learn what they want in their next venture!*

#### Prose & cons
Before you begin your search, take inventory of your current or previous job's prose and cons and consider what you want in your next role. Reflecting on your past experiences, work environment, and company culture will provide valuable insight.

#### What you want
Take time to contemplate your career goals, personal values, and the kind of work-life balance you desire. By doing so, you will be better equipped to find a position that aligns with your wants and needs.

#### Follow your passion
Taylor advises you to follow your passion! If given a new start, seek employment in an industry that truly resonates with your interests and talents!

### Get your resume set
Make sure your resume's written really well. Taylor explains your resume needs to be **achievement-based** rather than **task oriented**.

As a developer, you may be tempted only to add a sentence to your resume stating that you wrote React code, neglecting to elaborate on what your code accomplished.

**Achievement-based React code includes:**
* The software
* The platform
* What did it do
* How many users
* How many transactions per minute/second
    
*When adding programming experience to your resume, ensure that you include quantitative data and the purpose and solutions the program provides.*
