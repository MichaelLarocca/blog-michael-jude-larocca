### How to prepare for a technical  interview

**Researching the company you're applying to will give you a competitive advantage!**

When applying for a specific position, make sure to read the job description thoroughly. When interviewing, it's best to know what technologies they use ahead of time.

**Examples of technologies:**
* React Framework
* Vue Framework
* MERN Stack
* MEAN Stack

Study the job description as if you are studying for a test. With this method, even if you lack experience with some technologies, you will have ample time to research them enough to discuss them insightfully.
