### How to prepare for a technical  interview
**Researching the company you're applying to will give you a competitive advantage!**

When applying for a specific position, make sure to read the job description thoroughly. When interviewing, it's best to know what technologies they use ahead of time.

**Examples of technologies:**
* React Framework
* Vue Framework
* MERN Stack
* MEAN Stack

Study the job description as if you are studying for a test. With this method, even if you lack experience with some technologies, you will have ample time to research them enough to discuss them insightfully.

### Have a solid portfolio
What is a portfolio? A portfolio is a website, or page on a website, displaying your works. While there are plenty of standard portfolio projects, such as weather apps and calculators, Kyle recommends creating one or two exceptionally unique ones that showcase our programming capabilities and help us to stand out from the crowd. 

For example, if you are great with front-end design, you could create several apps, even if they are not functional. Also, consider building a UI library or other open-source project for others to use and contribute.  

**It is best to give potential employers "something to look at." Kyle elaborates it is not about how many green contribution squares you have on GitHub but the quality of each contribution square! The ability to create and maintain open-source projects and your code quality demonstrate your competency and capabilities to employers.**

### Get comfortable with Git
As Kyle mentioned, prospective employers want to ensure that you can work with source control in a team environment. Using it on your own is great, but it's in your best interest to get experience working with others. 

**Common interview questions include:**
* Do you have version control experience working with other developers
* Do you use conventional commit messages
* Can you merge pull requests
* Are you familiar with other common Git-based operations

**So how can you get this experience before ever working on a team? A great way is to contribute to open-source projects! You will become familiar with team-based Git operations by actively contributing.**

*An excellent place for beginners to get started with open-source is the EddieHub community! [EddieHub](http://eddiehub.org/) is an open-source community that encourages and promotes communication best practices, as well as
technical expertise in an inclusive and welcoming environment.*

### Your GitHub profile
Your GitHub profile is an excellent way to showcase your skill and experience.

**By pinning your best repositories, you provide an easy way for prospective employers to see your capabilities at a glance.**

---

***Tip:*** *On your GitHub profile, you can pin up to six of your best projects for others to view.*

**On Kyle's pinned repositories, you can see he uses the following languages:**
* TypeScript
* Go
* Shell
* JavaScript

Viewing his pinned repositories, you can also see he has as many as 236 stars and 207 forks, which shows the popularity of the projects! In addition, there are also repositories demonstrating he has experience working with other developers.

### Data structures and algorithms
For Kyle, data structures and algorithms have not come up that much regarding interviews. 

**Through Twitter, Kyle has noticed data structures and algorithms are common during interviews in India. So it would be best for you to research your area to determine if it's a requirement.**

Needing to know data structures and algorithms in the USA is more common when interviewing for higher-level jobs and for FAANG jobs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google).

Kyle advises us not to stress over data structures and algorithms when applying for entry-level positions. However, learning them will be good and give you a competitive advantage!

### Testing 
With test-driven development, you write unit tests before you write the code. The idea of unit testing is to write functional code with expected outputs.

**An example is writing a unit test for an adding function involves:**
* Taking in two parameters (numbers)
* Expecting one output (number)

After the unit test successfully passes, by adding the two parameters and then returning the one expected output, you then write the function.

Kyle informs us that there are different levels of testing. As self-taught developers, we can start by learning unit testing, then learn the testing used at the companies we are employed. 

**Larger companies use other types of testing, such as:**
* End-to-end testing
* Load testing
* Smoke testing

If you are comfortable with unit testing, Kyle tells us we will have gained the core skills, and with them, we will be able to learn other types of testing quickly.

**If you can knowledgeably talk about test-driven development or have experience with it, Kyle tells us we are already doing great!**

**Danny Thompson said during the Livestream,** *"I â€‹definitely agree with Kyle, and we have spoke about this before. If you understand testing and can speak about it in an interview, you will definitely have an edge in your favor!"*
