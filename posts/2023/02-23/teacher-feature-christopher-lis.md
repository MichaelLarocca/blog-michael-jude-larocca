### Learning JavaScript

**Have you ever been taught complicated formulas in a math class and asked yourself,** *"will I ever use these formulas in day-to-day life?"*

When learning JavaScript, coding concepts can feel daunting when out of context and difficult to comprehend without practical application.

**Christopher skillfully and articulately teaches complicated JavaScript concepts by taking us step-by-step through "what the code does" and "how and when to use it."** 

A great example of how Christopher teaches with clarity is during his Asteroids-style game; in his [HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript Game Tutorial](https://youtu.be/eI9idPTT0c4), he teaches us how to create a player and an enemy class, a function to spawn the enemies and an array to push them in. 

**While coding a player and enemies, we learn about the following:**
* Classes
* Functions
* Arrays	

Christopher then shows us how to shoot the enemies with projectiles and have the spawned enemies attack us by creating and using functions that calculate angles.

**By creating these functions, we learn about the following:**
* Atan2 function
* Angles
* Velocity
* Sine 
* Cosine 

*While having fun coding this JavaScript game, we are already learning advanced coding concepts and using them with practical applications, which is a great way to understand and retain what we know!*
