### Creating an account

Creating an iCodeThis account is simple; the process is fast and broken down into two sections, profile and social.

When completed, your profile displays as a delightful card.

**Profile**
* Email
* Username
* Bio
* Website
* Photo

#### **Email**
You use your email to log in via [Magic Link](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-magic-link), a form of passwordless login where you click on a link sent to your email address to log into your account.

#### **Username**
Your username is prominent on your profile card, and your member joined date displays directly below it.

#### **Bio**
The bio section provides you an opportunity to let others know more about you.

#### **Website**
You can only add one URL for your website, so I decided to provide my newly created [LinkFree](https://selftaughttxg.com/2023/01-23/linkfree-connect-to-your-audience-with-a-single-link/) address! 

#### **Photo**
There is a button provided for you to upload a photo. I decided to use my LinkedIn profile photo.

**Social**
* Github
* Twitter
* Instagram
* Youtube
* Tiktok

To add social icon links to your profile, fill out each section with your corresponding URL address.  

I added GitHub and Twitter.  

***Note:*** *If you are experiencing issues with your profile URLs, make sure not to include the domain, just the path.*
