### What is a Full Stack Designer?

Gary defines a Full Stack Designer as one who can handle the entire process of designing a brand identity for a company, along with their associated user interfaces such as their websites and apps, and also be able to implement the user interfaces in the browser along with the implementation of any interactivity.

**Tools and skills include:**
* UI/UX Designer
* Frontend Developer (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Basic Identity Design Knowlege
* WebGL / Threejs / Shaders Knowledge

#### UI/UX Designer

Gary tells us a full stack designer is first a UI/UX designer, with more focus on the UI design.

Although UI (User Interface) is a subset under the umbrella term of UX (user experience), Gary thinks a full-stack designer doesn't need to have a solid foundation in research and testing, which is another pillar of UX design; you can still consider yourself a UI/UX designer if you understand UX design patterns.

#### Frontend Developer (HTML/CSS/JS)

Although HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the foundation of Frontend web development, to consider yourself a UI/UX designer, you only have to concern yourself with a subset of JavaScript, such as DOM manipulation; interacting with databases would be out of a full-stack designer's scope.

#### Basic Identity Design Knowlege

Can you design an identity guideline? Can you create a logo and also understand brand identities? Although you would not have to be an expert, you will need a solid understanding of these principles as a full-stack designer.

#### WebGL / Threejs / Shaders Knowledge

**Gary tells us the following are optional full-stack designer skills:**
* WebGL
* Threejs 
* Shaders Knowledge

To be considered a full-stack designer extraordinaire, you must have WebGL, Threejs, and Shaders Knowledge.

Having these skills in your toolkit allows you to create impressive graphical experiences that exceed the capability of just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### UI/UX Design Fundamentals

Before becoming a full-stack designer, you must first learn the design fundamentals, also called design principles.

**UI/UX Design Fundamentals**
* Colors
* Contrast
* Typography
* White Space
* Alignment
* Scale
* Proximity
* Visual Hierarchy

**Colors**

To create a cohesive layout, you must learn color theory, including how colors work in a user interface.

**Contrast**

You must understand contrast, especially regarding the type, to ensure it is readable.

**Typography**

Typography is a field in and of itself. Nevertheless, you will need a basic understanding of the main principles.

**White Space**

When it comes to white space, you will need to understand how empty space plays an important role, even though it's a void!

**Alignment**

You must learn how to align content correctly along columns and rows. 

**Scale**

Understanding scale involves knowing how big pieces of content should be in a shared space.

**Proximity**

Understanding proximity involves knowing how close content should be in a shared space, also referred to as groupings.

**Visual Hierarchy**

Visual hierarchy involves placing importance on certain elements. Visual hierarchy can be achieved with size, color, and contrast, to name a few techniques.

**Gary created the fantastic YouTube tutorial "[The 2020 UI Design Fundamentals Crash Course](https://youtu.be/tRpoI6vkqLs)" to help us with learning the UI Design Fundamentals.**

### UI Design Software

To become a full-stack designer, you must learn how to use design software.

**Gary provides us with the following popular design software options:** 
* [Adobe Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
* [Penpot](https://penpot.app/)
* [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/)
* [Lunacy](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/lunacy-graphic-design-software/9PNLMKKPCLJJ?hl=en-us&gl=us&rtc=1)

**Gary creates excellent annual Figma crash courses on YouTube. If you are interested in learning this design software, check out the "[Ultimate Figma Crash Course 2023](https://youtu.be/o1nCmiW6auE) "YouTube tutorial!**

### UI Prototyping Software

What is prototyping software? Gary tells us prototyping software adds interactivity to the UI designs we create.

Figma has prototyping built-in, and Gary thinks that it is pretty good. However, if you want more advanced features, such as logic and conditionals, without the need for coding, he advises [ProtoPie](https://www.protopie.io/) and [Proto.io](https://proto.io/).

Gary informs us that we can import our Figma prototypes into these apps to add really cool interactivity!

**UI Prototyping Software**
* [ProtoPie](https://www.protopie.io/)
* [Proto.io](https://proto.io/)
