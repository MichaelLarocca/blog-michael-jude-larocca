### What is LinkFree?

What is LinkFree? [LinkFree](https://linkfree.eddiehub.io/) is a FREE, open-source platform that allows you to connect to your audience with a single link, similar to services like Linktree.

### Why use LinkFree?

**If you are a developer, content creator, writer, or learning in public, creating a LinkFree account will benefit you for several reasons:**
* Comparatively small user base
* Niche tech social platform
* Advertise your products
* Share your accomplishments
* Give and receive testimonials
* Share upcoming events your attending
* And more!

#### **Comparatively small user base**
LinkFree is a newer platform with just over 1,000 active users/profiles. 

Creating a LinkFree profile in its early stages will allow you to stand out significantly on the platform, making it easier for you to grow your network and online presence.

#### **Niche tech social platform**
In addition to a smaller user base compared to other platforms, currently, LinkFree consists of like-minded tech individuals.

#### **Advertise your products**
Do you have a book, course, or other product to sell? You can add links to them along with descriptions on your LinkFree profile!

#### **Share your accomplishments**
You can share your significant achievements in your "Milestones" section. 

#### **Give and receive testimonials**
Testimonials on LinkFree profiles are an excellent way for others to learn about each other at a glance.

You can let others know how they've helped you by writing testimonials. Additionally, others can also write testimonials about you!

#### **Share upcoming events your attending**
Are you attending upcoming conferences, meetups, virtual, or similar events?

### Features

**In this section of the article, we will take a look at LinkFree's current features:**
* Your Bio, Social links & Stats
* Search by Tags
* Your QR code
* Your Links
* Your Milestones
* Your Testimonials
* Your Events
* Community Events

#### **Your Bio, Social links & Stats**
In this section, you can provide a short bio and add social links via icons.

For my bio, I wrote "`Front-End Web Developer | **Writer** | Musician`" ( since it's Markdown language, I made Writer bold by surrounding it with asterisks).

When people view your profile, the total number is displayed next you your image. As you can see, Eddie used bold on "EddieHub" and "GitHub." 

![Your Bio](img/01-30-23/YourBio.png)

#### **Search by Tags**
Similar to tags on a blog article, you can add tags that relate to you on your profile.

When you click on a tag, for example, a javascript tag, you jump to the search page, now populated with other LinkFree members that have the corresponding tag, making it easy to network with others!

Currently, you can invent your own tags; you are not limited to pre-defined tags. However, this causes a known issue. Slight spelling differences, including upper/lowercase variations, separate users into separate groups ( javascript and JavaScript result in two groups). This issue is being addressed.

![Tags](img/01-30-23/Tags.png)

#### **Your QR code**
Now, this is really cool! You automatically get a QR code associated with your LinkFree account by just joining! 

You will see an icon for your QR code bouncing on the bottom left side of your profile picture. The page expands when you click the icon, revealing your QR code.

#### **Your Links**
And now, it is time for LinkFree's main feature, links! This section is where you create links to your other platforms. 

You can organize your links into several categories: business, socials primary, secondary, and others.

![MyLinks](img/01-30-23/MyLinks.png)

#### **Your Milestones**
On your profile, you will see a milestones tab. The milestones section displays the highlights of your career, such as earning a certification, your first paid gig in tech, starting a blog, YouTube, or similar accomplishments.

![Milestones](img/01-30-23/Milestones.png)

#### **Your Testimonials**
When other LinkFree members write testimonials about you, upon your approval, they will display in the testimonials section of your profile.

When someone writes you a testimonial, you will receive a GitHub notification. If you want to display the testimonial on your LinkFree profile, you will need to add a testimonial field to your JSON file that includes the LinkFree member's user name that gave you the testimonial. Don't worry, it's not as difficult as it sounds, and there is thorough documentation on the whole process.

![Testimonials](img/01-30-23/Testimonials.png)

#### **Your Events**
If you are attending upcoming events, in person or virtual, you can let others know in this section.

To add upcoming events to your profile, you will need to create a JSON file and have it merged via pull request. Again, no worries; the documentation is easy to follow.

![Your Events](img/01-30-23/YourEvents.png)

#### **Community Events**
All events posted by community LinkFree accounts, such as the EddieHubEddieHubCommunity, will be displayed in this section.

### Conclusion

As a developer, content creator, writer, or someone simply learning in public, you will significantly benefit from creating a LinkFree profile, as it provides you with so much more than just one link to all of your content.

LinkFree also offers you a spotlight in a small yet growing community of wonderful like-minded people to network with, resulting in a significantly greater chance of others discovering YOU than on similar services with much larger user bases.

As a platform, LinkFree is just getting started and already has many more features in the making. Since LinkFree is an open-source project, creating a profile empowers YOU! As part of the LinkFree community, you will have an opportunity to contribute, ultimately providing you with an overall inclusive say in where this fantastic project is going!
