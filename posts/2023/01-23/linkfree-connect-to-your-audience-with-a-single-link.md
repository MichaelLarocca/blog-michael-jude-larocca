### What is LinkFree?

What is LinkFree? LinkFree is a FREE, open-source platform that allows you to connect to your audience with a single link, similar to services like Linktree.

---

### Why use LinkFree?

**If you are a developer, content creator, writer, or learning in public, creating a LinkFree account will benefit you for several reasons:**
* Comparatively small user base
* Niche tech social platform
* Advertise your products
* Share your accomplishments
* Give and receive testimonials
* Share upcoming events your attending
* And more!

#### **Comparatively small user base**
LinkFree is a newer platform with just over 1,000 active users/profiles. 

Creating a LinkFree account in its early stages will allow you to stand out significantly on the platform, making it easier for you to grow your online presence.

#### **Niche tech social platform**
In addition to a smaller user base compared to other platforms, currently, LinkFree consists of like-minded tech individuals.

#### **Advertise your products**
Do you have a book, course, or other product to sell? You can add links to them along with descriptions on your LinkFree profile!

#### **Share your accomplishments**
You can share your significant achievements in your "Milestones" section. 

#### **Give and receive testimonials**
Testimonials on LinkFree profiles are an excellent way for others to learn about each other at a glance.

You can let others know how they've helped you by writing testimonials. Additionally, others can also write testimonials about you!

#### **Share upcoming events your attending**
Are you attending upcoming conferences, meetups, virtual, or similar events?

Let others know what upcoming events you're attending in your LinkFree events section.

#### **And more!**
LinkFree is an open-source project that is just getting started. Enhancements already in the works include login authorization, enhanced search features, and a more beginner-friendly interface.

***What is the best part about LinkFree? As it is an open-source project, YOUR ideas, opinions, and contributions matter in making the platform the best it can be!***

#### **Your Bio, Social links & Stats**

In this section, you can provide a short bio and add social links via icons.

For my bio, I wrote "Front-End Web Developer | `**Writer**` | Musician" ( since it's Markdown language, I made Writer bold by surrounding it with asterisks).

When people view your profile, the total number is displayed next you your image. As you can see, Eddie used bold on "EddieHub" and "GitHub."
