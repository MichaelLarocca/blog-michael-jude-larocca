### CodeMash

James has heard great things about this Conference for years and highly recommends it!

The CodeMash conference takes place in a Kalahari resort, which includes an indoor arcade, water park, and more, which is perfect for kids!

#### CodeMash 101

*[CodeMash](https://www.codemash.org/about/) is a unique event that educates developers on current practices, methodologies and technology trends in a variety of platforms and development languages. Held every January at the lush Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio, attendees will be able to attend a world-class technical conference amid Ohio's largest indoor waterpark. Nobody will frown if you show up in shorts, sandals, and your loudest t-shirt. You might even win a prize for doing so.*

*It's not just about a grind of sessions, but also providing attendees the opportunity of continuing the conversations and networking outside of the daily conference events. The goal has always been to achieve this mission by creating a conference environment that focuses on professionalism and respect for one another.*

### MagnoliaJS
*October 17-18, 2023, Mississippi Museum of Art in Jackson, MS* 

In contrast to James's previous picks, MagnoliaJS is a really small conference.

James attended this event last year with a bunch of his friends ( who were guest speakers ) and his [Compressed FM](https://www.compressed.fm/) co-host, [Amy Dutton](https://selfteach.me/).

The size of the conference was approximately 50 people, making it easy to participate; no worries about missing out on talks or which groups to attend since it was so intimate.

James tells us that as this is a small conference, we will have the ability to take in everything that it offers.

*🔗 Event website: [MagnoliaJS](https://www.magnoliajs.com/)* 

**Below is information from the conference website 🔽**

*October 15-17 in Raleigh, NC*

All Things Open was one of the most fun conferences James attended last year.

All Things Open is a large conference with an all-star lineup of speakers. James tells us the activities and engagement were great, and the downtown Raleigh area was fun and easy to get around.

*🔗 Event website: [ATO ](https://www.allthingsopen.org/)* 

**Below is information from the conference website 🔽**

*Why Attend All Things Open?*

*After all these years, open source skills are more important and sought after than ever.*

*More than anything, ATO is an educational conference where attendees learn about new technologies and topics, and it’s always been that way. The goal is for attendees to leave having learned something or been made aware of something new.*
