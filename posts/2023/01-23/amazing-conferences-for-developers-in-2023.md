### CodeMash 
*Full-stack conference in Sandusky, United States Jan 10-13, 2023*

James has heard great things about this Conference for years and highly recommends it!

The CodeMash conference takes place in a Kalahari resort, which includes an indoor arcade, water park, and more, which is perfect for kids! 

*üîó Event website: [CodeMash](https://dev.events/conferences/code-mash-sandusky-0-2023)*

**Below is information from the conference website üîΩ**

#### CodeMash 101

*[CodeMash](https://www.codemash.org/about/) is a unique event that educates developers on current practices, methodologies and technology trends in a variety of platforms and development languages. Held every January at the lush Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio, attendees will be able to attend a world-class technical conference amid Ohio's largest indoor waterpark. Nobody will frown if you show up in shorts, sandals, and your loudest t-shirt. You might even win a prize for doing so.*

*It's not just about a grind of sessions, but also providing attendees the opportunity of continuing the conversations and networking outside of the daily conference events. The goal has always been to achieve this mission by creating a conference environment that focuses on professionalism and respect for one another.*
