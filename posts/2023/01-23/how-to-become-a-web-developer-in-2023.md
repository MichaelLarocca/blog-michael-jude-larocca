* Google
* How the internet works

#### Googling

**Jesse tells us that "Googling" is the best skill any developer can master.**

When you don't know how to fix an issue or need to learn how to accomplish a specific task, you should search online using Google.

Always do your best to research and try to resolve issues you have on your own before reaching out to the community. When reaching out to the community for help, be detailed. Be specific about the problem, what you tried, and what you already searched. 

Jesse tells us even the most experienced developers can't remember everything; they Google regularly.

#### How the internet works

**When first getting started, you need to have a basic understanding of how the internet works.**

**Internet**
* browsers
* domains
* hosting HTTP/HTTPS
* DNS

*Jesse provides us with these resources to help us understand these concepts.*

### Tools

When you are ready to start coding, you must first set up your web developer environment.

**Basic Tools**
* Browsers
* Code editor
* Terminals

#### Browsers

Browsers are how your users view your applications. Depending on what browser they use, they may have different experiences. For that reason, developers test their applications on multiple browsers to ensure they are working as expected. 

**Major browsers:**
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/)
* [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)
* [Fire Fox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

#### Code editor

The most popular code editor for developers is Microsoft's [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and it's FREE!

Jesse has created plenty of content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@codeSTACKr) on how to install, configure, and become familiar with VS Code.

*If you want to dive deep into learning how to use VS Code, check out Jesse's [Become a VS Code SuperHero](https://www.vscodehero.com/) course.*

#### Terminals

As a developer, you will want to become comfortable using the command line (terminal). Every operating system comes with a terminal.

**Terminals**
* command prompt (comes with Windows)
* powershell (comes with Windows)
* [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

**If you are using Microsoft Windows, you are not limited to the preinstalled terminals. Jesse, and many developers, including myself, use [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win).** 

*If you want to learn how to use the command line, check out Brad Traversy's [Command Line Crash Course For Beginners | Terminal Commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwAqEzhyjtw).*

*Brad Traversy also has a helpful YouTube scripting course, [Shell Scripting Crash Course - Beginner Level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-F3YLd6oMw).*

### Front-End Web Developer
(WRITE ARTICLE SECTION)

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

#### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to display in a web browser. HTML is the web's main building block and provides a website's structure.

**Jesse provides us with the following HTML resources:**
* [HTML in 100](https://youtu.be/ok-plXXHlWw)
* [HTML Crash Course](https://youtu.be/XiQ9rjaa2Ow)

#### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to style the content on a webpage; we use CSS to style HTML elements. We also use it to add flair to a website, such as transitions and animations.

Jesse tells us there is a lot to CSS, and if you're planning to be a Front-End Developer, it is essential to understand CSS fully.

**After you learn the basic syntax, learn the following:**
* Flexbox
* Grid
* Responsive Web Design

**Jesse provides us with the following CSS resources:**
* [CSS in 100](https://youtu.be/OEV8gMkCHXQ)
* [CSS Crash Course](https://youtu.be/Tfjd5yzCaxk)
* [Position Explained](https://youtu.be/XrHMv_9LCfo)

* [Grid in 100](https://youtu.be/uuOXPWCh-6o)
* [Grid Crash Course](https://youtu.be/0-DY8J_skZ0)

#### JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used in Front-End and Back-End development. We use it to make web pages interactive.

**When it comes to JavaScript, Jesse tells us that we will need to spend most of our time learning the following :**
* Basic syntax
* DOM
* Fetch API
* JSON
* ES6

---

***Important:*** *Before learning a framework such as React or Vue, you must fully understand JavaScript (also known as Vanilla JavaScript)*.

### Working with APIs

An API (application programming interface) is code that enables software programs to communicate.

APIs allow you to perform queries or computations on the back end and then send the results to the front end.

Jesse explains requesting data from a database as a simple example. The API on the server will perform that action and then send the data to the front end, allowing a layer of security for applications *(the front end would expose database login credentials, whereas the back end conceals them)*. 

**Jesse provides us with the following API resources:**
* [APIs in 100](https://youtu.be/-MTSQjw5DrM)
* [Build a REST API](https://youtu.be/l8WPWK9mS5M)
* [GraphQL in 100](https://youtu.be/eIQh02xuVw4)

### Version Control with Git & GitHub

Version control allows us to keep track of changes to our codebases. Version control is essential when working with other developers, such as on a team.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-source distributed version control system popular among developers.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.

**Git and GitHub are integral to the CI/CD pipeline (Continuous Integration/Deployment).**

---

### Hosting & deployment

As a developer, You must learn how to set up a hosting service and deploy a basic website.

Jesse tells us that a static host is the easiest way to accomplish this.

**Static hosts**
* Netlify
* Vercel
* Cloudflare
* GitHub pages

The provided list consists of static hosts that can be integrated with GitHub *(I use Netlify for my blog website)*.

When you use one of the static hosts with GitHub, you can set the configuration to rebuild and redeploy your website automatically every time you push changes to the GitHub repo. Very convenient!

If your application requires a true back-end environment, you will need a more traditional hosting service, such as [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Linode](http://www.linode.com/).

**Jesse provides us with the following hosting and deployment resources:**
* [Netlify Tutorial - How to build and deploy websites using Netlify](https://youtu.be/mT5siI19gtc)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
* [Getting Started with GitHub Pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [Linode](https://www.linode.com/)

### Full-Stack Web Developer
(WRITE ARTICLE SECTION)

**Back-end Development with Node.js**

Once you have learned JavaScript, you should learn [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). 

Node.js allows us to use JavaScript on the back-end server.

Express is a Node.js web application framework that provides features such as defining routes, building out APIs, connecting to databases, and more.

You will also need to learn with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager). Package managers allow us to easily add pre-built packages to our applications, which helps us accomplish various tasks without constantly "reinventing the wheel." 

**Jesse provides us with the following resources:**
* [Node.js Crash Course for Beginners Tutorial - Learn Node Basics in 30 Minutes!](https://youtu.be/2LUdnb-mls0)
* [Learn Express JS In 35 Minutes](https://youtu.be/SccSCuHhOw0)
